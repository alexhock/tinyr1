<think> Clearly, we are dealing with the numbers 84, 18, and 3. Let's start by looking at each number and thinking about how to combine them to approach 30.
Given that 30 is very close to 84/2, it could mean we should consider division in the formulation.
Multiplying 18 and 3 would give us 54, much larger than 30, so let's skip that for now.
Using 18 and dividing by 3 obviously gives us 6, not what we need.
Now remember 84 is the largest number, so we should think about subtracting smaller numbers from 84 to reach closer to our answer.
Subtracting 18 from 84 gives us 66, and dividing this by 3 would give us:
66 / 3 = 22, still not 30.
To get closer to 30, we should try subtracting 18 from another large number and see where that gets us:
(84 - 18) / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22.
Clearly, 22 is too far from our target of 30, so we need to try using 18 in a different way.
Now, let's consider using the numbers in a different order and think about subtraction and multiplication:
Try 18 * 3 = 54 and then subtract 24 from 84. We need to find a number that when subtracted from 84 gives 30.
84 - 54 = 30. So if we do 84 - (18 * 3), we get 30.
There we go! That's the equation we are looking for.</think>
<answer> (84 - (18 * 3)) </answer>

==============
<think>Firstly, let's consider if we can create 79 directly using two of the given numbers. The number 72 is close but not quite there. Maybe the equation involves addition or subtraction of 7 or 8, but 27, 21, and 41 seem too large to achieve that directly. We can also evaluate division and multiplication, but these operations typically lead to numbers under 20 or above 80, which doesn't help us reach 79.</think>
<think>Given that the target number is far from the nearest starting number (27), let's work on manipulating numbers to get close. I notice that 27 + 41 = 68, which is far from 79 and too low. But if we explore the operations with our chosen numbers, we may find the solution.</think>
<think>Let's consider using 21 and 72 in conjunction with 41. An operation that multiplies or divides 21 or 41 could potentially lead us closer to 79. But we'll start from 21 and add to it using the remaining numbers.</think>
<think>Let's try adding 41 and see if we can reach closely to 79. That's 21 + 41 = 62. We need 17 more to make 79. Now, consider the possibility of reducing our goal by dividing or using the remaining numbers. We cannot divide 72, but we can subtract from 72.</think>
<think>Notice that 72 - 41 = 31, and if we add 27, this gives 31 + 27 = 58. Now we need 21 more to reach 79, which is exactly the sum of 21 and 72 - 41.</think>
</think>
<answer> (21 + 72 - 41) + 27 </answer>
</answer>

==============
<think> Since we want to arrive at 30 and given the numbers 24, 65, and 59, intuitively, we need to utilize some subtraction. The number 65 is significantly higher than 30, so it seems like it might subtract a substantial amount from it at one point to make 30. Given 59 is close to 30, we could consider the feasibility of it as well. </think>
Let's start by looking at the possibility of subtracting 59 from 65 to get a reasonable value to work with.
<think> Adding 24 to the result of subtracting 59 from 65 should keep us moving towards our target of 30. </think>
<think> If we perform 65 - 59 = 6 first, then adding 24 to this result: 6 + 24 = 30, this would give us our desired result. Hence, the equation is: 65 - 59 + 24 = 30. </think>
<answer> 65 - 59 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication and division first since these can yield larger numbers (like 72) that can be closer to 12. The numbers we have are 72, 2, and 3. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6, and then dividing 72 by 6 gives us 12. Thus, the equation could be 72 / (2 * 3) which equals 12. </think>
<answer> 72 / (2 * 3) </answer>

==============
<think> Since the target is 47, and I am aiming to use each number, 33, 84, 38, and 34 only once, I'll try different permutations of the numbers and operations. Let's start with multiplication and division since they can significantly increase or decrease values to make the target more achievable.</think>
<think> Let's consider the pattern with 84: if we try to use this in conjunction with another number, like 33 and 38, we should see what multiplication would yield. 84 * 38 = 3212, which is already large and far from our target. Dividing 84 by any of these numbers will not help as the results will be under 47. </think>
<think> Let's move to operations between 33 and 38. Adding or subtracting these numbers yields: 38 - 33 = 5 or 33 - 38 = -5. We want the result to fit into how we can use the remaining numbers, 84 and 34, to reach 47. </think>
<think> So, we need to somehow manipulate 33, 38, and 84 with 34 to get 47. Adding 34 to 33 + 38 = 71 and then dividing by 84 does not work since we only have one number 84 to divide into 71+34. </think>
<think> Now let's try another combination using operations. If we divide 84 by 34, we get 2.47, which is not an integer and hence not useful here. Let's look at another combination considering subtraction: if we subtract 38 from 84, we get 46, close to our target but slightly above. We need to make 47, so an adjustment is required. </think>
<think> I believe the path is to take 38 from 84 and then use the subtraction approach with 33 and 34. If we subtract 33 from 34, we get 1, which is not immediately aligned, but subtracting 1 from 46 gives us 45, not quite there. Consequently, we need to find how 84 - 38 = 46 can be adjusted by 33 and 34 to be 47.</think>
<think> I realize adding 33 to 46 doesn't quite work. But subtracting 33 from 46 (another approach for another problem) would give us steps where I can align the remaining numbers. 34 is nearly equivalent to subtracting 34 from 46. Thus, (84 - 38) + (34 - 33) = 46+1 = 47. </think>
<answer> (84 - 38) + (34 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> 
Firstly, I need to create an equation using the numbers 72, 5, and 49 that results in 28, and each number can only be used once. I'll start by analyzing which combination of arithmetic operations might help. The number 72 seems too large to get down to 28 using multiplication or division with 49 or 5. Therefore, I will focus on using subtraction and addition.
</think>
<answer>
(72 - 49) + 5
</answer>
Let me work through the steps:
<think>
(72 - 49) + 5 = 23 + 5
</think>
<answer>
(72 - 49) + 5 = 23 + 5 = 28
</answer>
Therefore, the final equation is <answer>(72 - 49) + 5</answer>.

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 83 using the numbers 98, 92, and 77, with each number used only once and basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with the numbers, I see that 98 is the largest number, so I should consider what it could be subtracted by or added to. Subtracting or dividing by smaller numbers could get me closer to 83.
First, let's try to use addition. If I can find a way to get 98 - something close to 83, I might be on to something.
98 - 92 = 6, 98 - 77 = 21, 92 - 77 = 15
None of these closely match 83. Then let's try a tricky addition.
98 - 92 = 6 and if I use 92 + 77, I could get 75 + 9, 75 + some other numbers, etc.
Let's try: 77 + 92 = 169 - 86 = 83, but 86 isn't in the list of numbers.
What if I consider multiplication with one of the numbers:
(92 * 1) + 77 = 92 + 77 = 169 / 2 = 84.5 not 83.
Then, let's consider if combining subtraction and addition or multiplication works. If I first consider taking away 92 from 98, and then use the result with 77:
98 - 92 = 6, 6 + 77 = 83
This is the right path. </think>
<answer>(98 - 92) + 77</answer>

==============
<think> First, I would like to simplify the consideration of multiplication and division because they significantly affect the outcome and are more likely to achieve a precise sum when applied to the smallest remaining numbers. That leaves addition and subtraction. If I were to consider the subtraction first, I might want to reduce the larger numbers to make reaching 70 feasible. </think>
Given the numbers [5, 17, 84, 8], subtracting the smallest number (5) from the largest (84) leaves 79. If only addition is considered, adding 8 would bring us close to 70, making 84 - 5 + 8. This doesn't directly solve the problem, but it gets very close. I can adjust by alternately using subtraction and addition.</think>
<think> Considering the equation 84 - 5 + 8 - 17 = 70, the steps are as follows:
1. Start with 84.
2. Subtract 5, we get 79.
3. Add 8, making it 84 + 8 = 92.
4. Subtract 17, we obtain the final sum of 70.
This adheres to the rule of using each number exactly once and follows the mathematical operations as desired.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 5 + 8 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 3 and 77. While 77 is considerably bigger than 64, adding or subtracting 3 could be a starting point. Multiplying 3 by any number would make the result larger, and dividing 77 by 3 would not necessarily reduce the number to 64. Let's begin with the subtraction idea: 77 - 3 = 74. Now, we need to get the remaining 10 to reach 64. Substituting 74 with 10 and then subtracting will get us closer to 64: 74 - 10 = 64. </think>
<answer> (77 - 3) - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 51, 33, and 57. We need to combine them using arithmetic operations to achieve the result 27. 33 seems to be the easiest to use in this case because it's a neat round number. So I will use addition and subtraction with the other two numbers to get to 27. </think>
Since we need to get 27 and 33 is close, let's see if we can use 33 in any way to help us reach the result.
<think> I need to subtract from 33 to get 27, as 33 - 6 = 27. Now I need to find if I can generate 6 using the other numbers, 51 and 57. </think>
Now, let's look at using 51 and 57.
<think> I can subtract 51 from 57 to make 6. So the expression becomes 57 - 51 = 6. Now, putting this all together the equation looks like this:
33 - (57 - 51) = 27
</think>
<answer> 33 - (57 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the provided numbers [87, 18, 29] using basic arithmetic operations to make the expression equal to 40. I'll start by examining the numbers closely to find a combination that might work.
I notice that 87 and 18 do not make 40 easily when combined directly. I think I might need to use 29 in some operation. The numbers 87 and 18 can be manipulated by subtracting 29 from 87, resulting in 58, but then I need to subtract another 18 to get down to the target of 40.
So, this might be a good equation: 58 - 18 = 40.
But we are restricted to using each number only once. Therefore, let's see if 87 can be transformed in another way, maybe subtracting 29 from 87 and then subtracting the result of 18:
(87 - 29) - 18 = 40.
This satisfies the requirement of using each number only once and equals 40.
</think>
<answer>(87 - 29) - 18</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's think about what we need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide by to get from these numbers to 56. Given the numbers 19, 43, and 80, it seems we might need to use division or subtraction to adjust the total down. Multiplication or addition could make the numbers too large or too small.</think>
<think>Considering 43 as a significant starting point, if we can bring the other numbers close to 56, we might consider 80 to be our target after some manipulation. 
If we subtract 19 from 43 first, we get 24. Now, we need to get to 56, so we need to add 32 to 24, which is achieved by 80 - 48, but 48 is not one of the original numbers. 
Instead, let's think of the inverse: to get from 24 to 56 in one step, we need to add 32. We can see that 32 is 4 times 8, and 8 can be generated from 80 - 72, but none of these are part of the initial list either. 
So, let's think about just getting 43 to be close to 56 with the remaining operation. </think>
<think>80 - 43 = 37, which is not quite 56, but we can still use it. Now, to get from 37 closer to 56, we can try using the 19. 56 - 37 = 19. This can be seen as multiplying 19 by 1, but we have no other number to do this directly, so we'll use division or another approach.
If we examine 80 - (43 * 1) = 37 again in a different context, we see that we can invert the equation, thus returning to our original numbers in another method. Doing (80 - 43) + 19 = 56.
</think>
<answer>(80 - 43) + 19</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the three numbers available: 88, 98, and 57. The goal is to produce a result of 67 using basic arithmetic operations, with one of each of these digits plus the operations allowed. Let's try some combinations starting with subtraction first, as it often simplifies large numbers quickly. </think>
<think> Subtracting 57 from 98 gives us 41. Now we have 88 and 41 to work with. If we subtract 41 from 88, we get 47. However, we need 67, not 47. </think>
<think> Trying addition, if I add 57 to 98, I get 155, which is far from 67. As multiplication and division ensure the number we get is either a large or a small fraction of the starting number, I will focus on the addition and subtraction paths further. </think>
<think> Moving on, if I try another subtraction option: since 98 is quite close to 88, I might need to think about adding or multiplying strategically. Combining 57 and 88 with addition or multiplication does not simplify effectively towards 67. </think>
<think> Another approach is to think about what combination of operations would lead to 67 directly. Notice that operating with subtraction will help in creating the final result more efficiently. If I try to use 88 and 98 directly, I can consider 98 minus 88 equals 10. Now, if I add 57 to 10, I get 67. </think>
<answer> 98 - 88 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to arrive at the number 84 using the numbers 90, 57, and 51. Let's first try multiplication and division, as they have more significant effects when used with the available numbers.
Multiplying 90 by any of the other two numbers would give a product much larger than 84. Sure, 90 * 57 = 5130 and 90 * 51 = 4590 are far beyond 84.
Next, let's consider division. If I divide 90 by 57 or 51, the results will be less than 2, which certainly won't help reach 84. In fact, 90 / 51 and 90 / 57 both give numbers too low to interact with 57 or 51 to reach our target.
Multiplication and division by these numbers aren't yielding results that bring us close to 84. Let's then reconsider addition and subtraction, as these operations can bring us closer to 84 in a manageable way.
Adding or subtracting 57 or 51 from 90 or 51 does not bring us to 84. For instance, 90 - 57 = 33, 90 - 51 = 39, 57 + 90 = 147, and 51 + 90 = 141.
Let's try combining operations in another way. Given that 90 is the largest number, we might try 'subtracting' 57 and 'adding' 51, and check if this combination can lead us to 84.
</think>
<think> Performing the combination 90 - 57 + 51 gives 84. Now I confirm that this aligns with the equation we need.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 57) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will take a look at the numbers provided: 38, 59, and 12. My goal is to get 85 using each of these numbers exactly once, and only using basic arithmetic operations. I should note that there may be multiple solutions, but I will focus on a logical sequence that reflects a straightforward path to the solution. 
An obvious first step would be to check the sum of all three numbers as the numbers are not large and two might help get close to 85. Their sum is 38 + 59 + 12 = 109, which is not 85 but is closer. The difference is 24, which might be achieved by subtraction. 
I will start by substraction 12 from the sum. </think>
<answer>(38 + 59) - 12</answer>
This gives us 97 - 12, which is 85.</answer>
</think>
<answer> (38 + 59) - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I will first examine what operations need to be performed on the numbers to equal 97. Given 38 and 66, adding or subtracting these numbers do not seem to lead to 97. Multiplying them results in 2,448, which is way too high, and dividing them results in 0.53846, which is too low. Therefore, multiplication and division by these numbers don't work.
Considering 7, if I add it to 38, I get 45, which isn't close to 97. If I subtract 7 from 38, I get 31, which is also not correct.
Next, I think about how 7 and 66 could be used together. Multiplying 7 by 66 gives me 462, which is much too high. Subtracting 7 from 66 gives me 59, which is closer but still far from the target of 97.
Since I need to reach 97 from 59, I should try to use subtraction or addition to adjust, but my available number is 38. If I add 38 to 59, I get 97. Therefore, one equation that satisfies the condition is 38 + 59 - 66 = 97.
</think>
<answer>38 + (66 - 7)</answer>

==============
<think> We are using the numbers 19, 14, and 87 and need to arrive at 54. First, let's consider if we can use any of these numbers as part of a subtraction or combination for quicker results.
Given the numbers, subtraction might not be immediately useful as it would not be straightforward to get close to 54, even when using -87.
Multiplication and division on these individual numbers also don't seem to be leading us to 54 easily.
Let's then consider combinations. If we use 19 and 14, their sum is 33, and then subtracting from 87 gives us 54. So, 87 - 19 - 14 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 19 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers [11, 58, 49] to create an equation that equals 96. I notice that 58 and 49 are quite large numbers, so they might be the target or a part of it.
Let's consider if multiplication of 58 and 49 would lead us close to or exactly equal 96. Calculating 58 * 49:
58 * 49 = 2882, which is far from 96.
Next, let's consider potential subtractions with these numbers. Let's consider:
58 - 49 = 9.
This much closer, but still far from 96. Let's see if we can use the 11 and try other combinations:
11 + 85 = 96, but 85 is not a number closest to 58 or 49.
We need to consider division. Let's explore:
58 / 49 = 1.183... This doesn't help as it's not close to a whole number.
Thus, we need to use the remaining number 11 and see if we can combine it with the other numbers:
(58 - 49) + 11 could potentially work.
58 - 49 = 9.
9 + 11 = 20, which is not equal to 96.
Now let's arrange them in a way where a different combination could work:
Considering (58 + 49) - 11 for now, because we need to get to 96.
(58 + 49) = 107.
107 - 11 = 96.
This is the break we needed.
</think>
<answer>(58 + 49) - 11</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by considering the numbers and the arithmetic operations. I notice that the final result needs to be 88, and we need to use all three numbers: 57, 16, and 47 exactly once. 
Working on these, I recall that multiplication could yield a large number quickly. Let's see if multiplying 57 and 16 gives a number close to or exactly 47 times some other number.
\[ 57 \times 16 = 912 \]
This is too large, so I need to reduce the result. 
Now, let's consider dividing instead. If I divide 912 by 11, I get:
\[ 912 / 11 \approx 82.91 \]
This is far from our target of 88, so a different approach is needed.
I recall that 47 could be subtracted or added to the division result, or we can think in reverse. What if I take 47, multiply it by the fraction of 16/57, and adjust accordingly?
\[ \text{Let} \quad 47 \times \frac{16}{57} = x \]
Calculating the value of x:
\[ x = 47 \times \frac{16}{57} = \frac{752}{57} \approx 13.14 \]
I need a number close to 55-13. 14 = 41. Now, taking the difference between 88 and 41 to get 47.
Using the equation:
\[ 88 = 47 + (57 - 16) \]
Now, let's express this in the required format.
</think>
<answer> (57 - 16) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll go through the numbers: 46, 48, and 39. I want to arrive at 37 using basic arithmetic operations on these numbers.
I can easily see that 46 + 48 doesn't yield 37. Moving on.
48 - 46 gives 2, which isn't useful for our goal. Let's try a different approach.
48 - 39 = 9. Now I have 9, 46, and 48 to work with, and 37 is our target.
46 - 9 = 37. Now I have arrived at 37. Let's confirm the whole expression.
(The expression would be 46 - (48 - 39)). </think>
<answer> 46 - (48 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers that are closer to 55. Here we are looking for a combination that equals 55 using the numbers 66, 70, and 51.
Using subtraction, if we take 70 from 66, we get 4. So, (70 - 66) = 4. 
Now we need to get from 4 to 55. Adding 51 to 4 does not work as it gives us 55.
If we use a different approach, we can realize that (70 - 66 = 4). Now, to reach 55, we can try another combination. Since we can't use 70, let's try to find something with 51 to get us closer.
Considering multiplication or division with 51, dividing 51 by 51 equals 1 and adding this to 4 does not give us 55.
Lastly, let's consider the possibility of using simple addition or subtraction. With 51 being larger and 66 closer to our target, we can look at subtraction:
(70 - 66) + 51 = 4 + 51 = 55. </think>
<answer>(70 - 66) + 51</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need an equation that can reach 66 using the available numbers: 27, 3, and 90. A good strategy here is to use multiplication or division to get closer to 66, since dealing with 66 itself is too high for our available numbers. Let's multiply 90 by some number to reach this value. If I multiply 90 by 2, it equals 180, which is quite far from 66. If I multiply 90 by 1. 5, I get 135, still not close enough but moving in the right direction. Multiplying by 1. 133333... is too precise. Let's try another route.
Since 90 is pretty large, using it as a base, I could subtract or add other numbers to reach 66. If I divide 90 by 1. 428571... (which is 3/2), I get 64, which is close. Now, if I subtract 3, I get 61, and if I subtract 27, I get 34. That's nearer to 66, but still not there.
So let's see if I can make another small adjustment. What if I add 3 to 64 (i.e., 90/2. 667) and then add 2? That would be 65. And to reach 66, I just need to add 1. Now, 1 cannot be made from our numbers, so I need to think of a way to get 65 and then add 1. It seems multiplication and division are leading me astray. Let's switch to addition. If I take 90 and add 3, I get 93. Now, I can subtract 27 to reach 66: 93 - 27 = 66. </think>
<answer> 90 + 3 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll need to figure out how to use the numbers 64, 8, and 94 to get the result of 38. 
Considering the target number we need to achieve is 38, I think one effective way is to use the largest number (94) to reduce the target number closer to 38. Let's think of using subtraction here.
Using 94 - 64 gives us 30. Now, to get the final result of 38, we will need to add 8 to 30. This fits all the given constraints - we are using each number only once and performing valid arithmetic operations.
So the equation will be: (94 - 64) + 8.
</think>
<answer>(94 - 64) + 8</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should recognize that the result we need to achieve is 59, which is quite far from the smallest number, 1. Since 20 is the largest number and has both addition and multiplication potential, I should start by examining how 20 can be used to reach closer to 59.
20 can be multiplied by 3 to yield 60, which is just 1 short of 59. But that will require 59/3 which isn't an integer, so it's out. We should consider doing 20 * 3 and then subtracting 1 from the result.
1 * 3 equals 3. Subtracting 1 from 3 leaves us with 2.
Therefore, 20 * 3 - 1 = 59.
So, the equation is 20 * 3 - 1.
</think>
<answer>20 * 3 - 1</answer>

<think> For our numbers [42, 83, 23], the final result we need is 18. The first number 42 seems big enough that it can help get us closer to 18, and the other two numbers are small enough to fine-tune the result.
Let's consider the relationship between the numbers. By inspection, 83 - 42 - 23 would give us something between 0 and 18. We need 18, so we can use multiplication or division to scale it up. 

Now, we see we need to reduce the number to 18, and 83-42-23 = 18. So, we need to make this equation simpler using the available operations and numbers.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 42 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers: 68, 53, and 91. To get to 76, we need to perform some basic arithmetic operations. 
Since 91 is the largest and furthest from 76, it's possible we might need to take 91 away to get close to 76. But 91 - 76 = 15, so that wouldn't help.
Next, let's consider subtraction between 68 and 53. This gives us 15, but again, we need to get to 76.
What if we tried using multiplication and division? Considering 68 * 1 = 68, 68 / 1 = 68, and 91 / 1 = 91. We can use 91 to reach our target, but we'll need to find a way to add or subtract to get to 76. 
Let's see:
- If we divide 91 by 1 (which is 91) and then multiply by 1 (which is 1), we get 91 * 1 = 91. So, we're still far from 76.
- If we take 68 and divide by 1 (which is 68) and then add 53 (which is 53 + 68 = 121), we're still not in the right ballpark. But 68 / 1 = 68, and 68 + 53 = 121.
Now we see that 68 + 53 = 121, but we need to get to 76. This means we need to subtract 45 from 121 to reach 76.
We know that 91 can't be directly used here since it's much larger. Let's think of other operations. Perhaps we can subtract 68 or 53 from 91. 
If we perform 91 - 68 = 23, that's not 76. Let's try 91 - 53 = 38. Still not there.
Finally, let's combine these into one equation: 91 - 68 = 23, then 23 + 53 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 68 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the equation which should use only the numbers 27, 38, and 78 once and lead to the result 67. 
Let's start with simple operations combining these numbers. One approach is to see if adding or subtracting these numbers can almost equal 67.
Combining 78 - 38 = 40, but I need to reach 67, so this isn't quite right. Now, considering multiplication or division with the remaining number 27, as in 38 * 27/27 = 38, another 27 isn't allowed. 
Next, let's think of combining 27 and 38 with subtraction or addition. If I add 27 and 38, it equals 65, which is closer to 67. Then I need two additional units to reach 67. Maybe the remaining 27 can help this way: 65 + 27 - 38 = 64 + 27 - 38, but this isn't equal to 67. 
Instead, let's experiment with more complex combinations. Adding 27 and 38 gives 65. We could consider 65 plus some operation with 27. Now, 65 / 27 isn't an integer, but 65 - 27 = 38. Plugging this into the equation, we get 65 - 27 + 27 = 65, and adding -27 (which is not allowed) or rearranging like 65 + (27 - 27) = 65 again doesn't help.
Thinking about multiplication and division, 78 * 38/27 = 10868/27, which is not a whole number, so I can't directly use this. Let's try (78/27) * 38 = 38 * 38/27 = 1444/27, again not a whole number.
Lastly, a recombination is needed. Let's try a different numerical addition and subtraction approach: (78-27) + 38 = 51 + 38 = 89, which is too high; subtracting should get us closer. Let's try (78-38) + 27 = 40 + 27 = 67, perfect!
</think>

<answer> (78 - 38) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> The target is 89 and we have the numbers 96, 73, 29, 95. We need to use all numbers exactly once and only the basic arithmetic operations are allowed. 96 and 95 are higher than 89, 73 and 29 are more on the lower side, so there may be a combination for reaching 89. First, consider what subtraction or addition between 96 and 95 gives us close to or equal to 89:
96 - 95 = 1,
95 - 96 = -1.
Neither of these get us close to 89. Next, we should consider multiplication. Notice 73 * 2 = 146 and 73 * 1 = 73 where both are too large for our needs. Now, let's consider 73 divided by 29 or 29 divided by 73:
73 / 29 is approximately 2.517 and 29 / 73 is approximately 0. 397. Neither of these operations come close to necessary to our target 89.
Considering the smaller numbers 29 and 73, let's test: we can obtain 29 * 3 = 87, and we need 89. If we reconfigure 29 + 3 = 32 and then 73 + 32 = 105 which is more than we need. Also, we can eliminate the need for 32 by finding the leftover after subtraction.
The number 73 is higher than 89, so let's think if we can get the difference. If we use 96 and subtract 73, we get:
96 - 73 = 23.
We're still far short of getting 89, and adding any numbers or operations might not yield the needed result. Let's reconsider using the other lower number 29 and 73 together in different ways:
(96 - 73) * 29 / 1000 is unlikely since 1000 is too large for an effective operation result.
96 - 73 - 29 does not reach the target either.
There's still 95 left, it seems we should find a way to use that and 29 or 73 in an operation. Multiplying or adding might work:
(95 - 73) * 29 = 22 * 29 = 638.
That's too large. But by adjusting, we can:
29 * 73 / 95 = 2123 / 95 = 22.468 which is around 22, and then:
96 - 22 = 74, 74 + 15 = 89.
But there's no way to get 22 from provided numbers.
Looking at the equation again, we need 22 and are short, and:
73 * 29 / 95 = 2227 / 95 = 23. 35 is closer but still leaving us short.
Considering 96 - 95 leaves 1.
Then, we need to reach 87 by some operations with 29 and 73.
Thus the original and added 1 from 96 - 95 can be adjusted:
73 + 29 + 1 = 103, which is not our target.
Therefore, the final closest combination from given number operations logic:
(96 - 73) * 29 / 1000 is not applicable, 29 * 73 is too large, 73 - 29 = 44 which is not enough, we're left with:
96 - 73 - 29 + 1 = 95 - 102 = -7.
But we need 89, so let's reiterate:
96 - 73 - 29 + 95 = 89.
Hence the final equation that equals 89 is: 96 - 73 - 29 + 95 = 89.</think>
<answer> 96 - 73 - 29 + 95 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the arithmetic operations we can use to approach 83. Since the numbers to operate on are 68, 95, and 80, a useful calculation could be the sum of 68 and 80, then adjusting that result to get to 83 with 95. Let's start with 68 + 80 = 148. We need to reduce it to 83 using 95. The logical way to do this operation given the numbers is subtraction, where 148 - 95 could yield the solution. However, with the current setup, we're 95 - 148 = -53, which is not correct.
Another approach could be to consider 95 as a multiplier and see if we can get closer to 83 by adjusting the first two numbers. Let's try 95 / 1 = 95. This is clearly not the approach we need either, as we need to reduce from 148 to 83. Taking this one step further, we realize that by manipulating 68 + 80, maybe we can use multiplication or division differently.
Given we need to get to exactly 83, let's try the breakdown as 95 + 68 - 80. This is because we know 95 and we need to adjust this to come closer to 83. Performing the operation, 95 + 68 - 80 = 83. </think>
<answer>95 + 68 - 80</answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 24, 73, and 20 that equals 69. We can start by calculating the differences and sums between these numbers, as well as looking at the multiplication and division operations. As we know, we can only use each number once.
1. First, let's see if we can subtract any of the numbers from 73 or add 20 to it to approach 69.
   - 73 - 24 = 49
   - 73 - 20 = 53
   - 73 - 20 + 20 = 73
   - Adding 20 to 73 doesn't help us reach the required number accurately. Subtraction seems promising since we can further reduce the difference to reach 69.
2. Let's try subtracting 20 from 73 first, and then checking if we can get to 69 by calculating with 24:
   - From above, we have 73 - 20 = 53.
   - We need 53 - ? = 69. But this subtraction is too large, so let's try the other possible combination.
   - Next, let's see if we can take 24 away from 73 in a way that helps get us to 69.
   - 73 - 24 = 49, and then 49 - 20 = 29, and 29 - 10 = 19 and we are still far away from 69.
   - Let's try to take 24 from 73 and then use 20 to adjust the result.
   - 20 can be subtracted from 24 to make it 73 - (24 - 20) = 20.
     This results in 73 - 24 + 20 = 69, which equals 69.</think>
<answer> 73 - 24 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 51, 59, and 83 where each number can only be used once, I'm going to try various combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the possibility of subtraction and addition since the numbers seem close to 75. I'll check if subtracting 59 from 83 will result in a number close to the one we need to add to 51 to reach 75.
83 - 59 = 24.
Now we need another number that can be obtained by adding 51 to 24, resulting in 75.
51 + 24 = 75.
So our numbers and operations are combined to give us 83 - 59 + 51 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 59) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider using addition and subtraction to try to get close to 58 with the given numbers. Taking a look at 69 and 16, their sum would be 85, which is 27 more than 58. 
Now, think about reducing this by using 5. We know 59 is just 16 short of 75 (which could be derived from 16 * 5) and 69 divided by 1 is 69. The difference between 59 and 69 is 10. Thus, we would need to remove 20 from our sum of 85 to get to 58, which can be accomplished by subtracting 16 from 69 and adding 5. Therefore, the equation would be: 69 - 16 + 5 </think>
<answer> 69 - 16 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how to make 50 using the numbers 2, 2, and 50. One way to approach this is to look for a combination that involves at least one of the zeros which could be derived from the number 50. We know that 50 / 2 = 25. Also, 50 + 2 = 52 but we need to reduce that to 50. Let's see if we can subtract 2 from this result. If we take 52 - 2 we get 50. So, I can form this equation using the numbers available.</think>
<answer> (50 + 2) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 53, 62, and 2 to create an equation that equals 22. The goal is to do this using basic arithmetic - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number must be used just once.
Let's start by thinking about the 2. It's a small number close to the target 22, so it might be useful in a subtraction or division.
Now I will consider the other two numbers: 53 and 62. Given that 22 is relatively small compared to these two numbers, it's possible that division or some combination of the other two numbers can significantly reduce the value. 
Let's test division. 62/2 = 31, which is closer to 22 than 53, but still isn't there. Now if we subtract 31 from 53 we have 22, which is the number we want. So, let's form the equation based on this.
</think>
<answer> (53 - 62 / 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add the numbers to see if I can get closer to 77. Starting with 70 and 48, I get:
70 + 48 = 118, which is too large. Next, I'll try combining the other two numbers 70 and 55:
70 + 55 = 125, still too large. Lastly, I'll try adding 48 and 55:
48 + 55 = 103, still quite a bit off. Now, I'll think about subtraction to reach the number. By subtracting the smallest number (48) from the largest (70):
70 - 48 = 22. This is still not enough, but it's closer. Now I'll try using the difference found (22) with 55:
77 - 55 = 22. This works! Therefore, we can use the equation:
77 = 55 + (70 - 48) </think>
<answer> 55 + (70 - 48) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 77, 86, and 89 to get 98. From the given numbers, 89 and 86 are close to 98. So I will consider adding 86 and 89 first, which gives me:
86 + 89 = 175
Now, 175 is much higher than 98, so I need to do a negative operation to get closer to 98. However, if I subtract 77 from 175, I get:
175 - 77 = 98
This way, all numbers are used once and the equation equals 98. </think>
<answer> 86 + 89 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> The numbers we have to work with are 34, 25, and 53. Our goal is to reach the number 44 using these numbers only once and any combination of arithmetic operations. 
Considering the size of the numbers, we might need to look for a subtraction or a division to reduce the value.
Let's try subtracting 34 and 25 first:
34 - 25 = 9
Now, we are left with 9 and 53. We can check how to utilize these to arrive at 44. Subtracting 53 from 9 won't help, and adding or multiplying won't give us 44 as the final result.
Now let's try to think of division. If we divide 53 by 13, we will get 4 with a remainder, but we cannot use 13. Let's try dividing by other numbers.
Dividing 53 by 25 yields 2 with a remainder of 8, which doesn't help us. Let's try dividing 53 by 34:
53 / 34 = 1.56 (not an integer, so this is not viable)

Given the options we have, let's try another approach:
We see that (53 - 25) = 28, which, given that we want to subtract this amount from 34 to get 44, we can rearrange the equation.
34 - 28 = 6.
Now, if we do 6 * 4, we get 24. That means:
53 - 34 = 19,
19 + 24 = 43, and if we do it a final time:
43 + 1 = 44
So we need another operation to get from 24 to 44.
24 + 20 = 44
We've already used 34, 25, and 53, and 20 cannot be made using just these numbers and operations, and shouldn't use a new number.
Thus, we now need to use the numbers in a combination that doesn't violate the rule that each number can be used only once. An alternative might be to use what we have left and add them up.
Considering:
53 - 34 = 19
19 + 25 = 44
This satisfies the conditions.</think>
<answer> 53 - 34 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I want to form an equation using the numbers 65, 20, 3 that results in 42. To achieve this, I will start by deducting smaller numbers from a larger number. The first step could be 65 - 20, which equals 45. Now I have to reduce by 3 to get to 42. I can do that by subtracting 3 from 45. (65 - 20) - 3 = 42. Now the equation using the numbers once is: 65 - 20 - 3 = 42. </think>
<answer> (65 - 20 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I see we have the numbers 36, 22, and 58 to work with and need to find an equation that equals 44 using basic arithmetic operations. 
- First, let's consider the numbers in relation to 44. We can try subtracting 22 from 36: 
  36 - 22 = 14
- Having 14, we can add 58 to get closer to 44:
  14 + 58 = 72
- Since 72 is too large, let's subtract 72 from 44:
  44 - 72 = -28 (Not what we want)
- As a next approach, negative numbers could also be considered. If we subtract 36 from 58:
  58 - 36 = 22
- But then, if we add 22 to 22, we don't match 44:
  22 + 22 = 44 (This works! )
- So, the equation combining these steps would be 58 - 36 + 22 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 36 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider multiplying and dividing, as these are more likely to reduce the range of numbers (26, 36, 43) into manageable targets. I'll begin by trying to use 26 or 36 as the result, as they're in the middle.
- Using 36: The numbers that can be combined to give 36 are 43 - 7, but 7 is not among the numbers. 36 = 26 + 10, but 10 is not among the numbers. 36 can be written as 43 - 7, but 7 is not in the list. 36 cannot be formed using the numbers given in only one way.
- Using 26: I can subtract 43 - 26 = 7. But again, 7 is not among the numbers.
- It seems calculating with the numbers given to get 36 is impossible. Now, I'll look for the options left: 43 and 36. 
- For getting 33, 43 - 10 = 33, and 10 is 36 - 26. This means we could use 43 - (36 - 26) = 33.
</think>
<answer> 43 - (36 - 26) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to structure the equation in a way that uses the numbers 38, 19, and 3 only once, to get the result of 54.
One approach is to see if we can combine numbers or their operations to get close to 54. 38 and 19 add up to 57, which is close to 54 but a bit too large. If we subtract 3 from 57, it becomes 54. The equation could look something like (38 + 19) - 3.
Let's test this:
1. Calculate 38 + 19, which equals 57.
2. Subtract 3 from 57, which equals 54.
Hence, the equation that satisfies the condition is: (38 + 19) - 3.
</think>
<answer>(38 + 19) - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 65 and 49 which are relatively large in value. They are close together and may need to be manipulated using addition or subtraction to get them closer to 14. Given that 49 is closer to 50, the first thought is to subtract 49 from 65, which simplifies the equation to 16 - 65.
However, 16 - 65 is not equal to 14. I'll consider adding the numbers 2 and 49 and then subtracting 65 to see if I can get closer to 14. Adding 2 and 49 gives us 51. Then subtracting 65, we get -14, so that doesn't work either.
Moving on, I'll consider if I can use the numbers by performing addition first. Adding 65 and 2 gives us 67. Unfortunately, there seems to be no easy operation to perform with this to reach 14 that involves only subtraction.
Finally, there's the option to multiply. If I multiply 2 and 49, I get 98. Adding 65 to 98 does not give me 14, so this isn't suitable either.
Given all these approaches, it seems like subtracting could help. If I subtract 49 from 65, I get 16. The only way to get to 14 from 16 using the last number (2) is to subtract 2 from 16. This gives me the equation: 65 - 49 - 2 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 49 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 95, 13, and 14 to work with, and we need to create an equation that equals 68. Initially, 95 seems too large to be used directly in subtraction or division without overshooting our target. However, we could subtract 13 or 14 from 95, and then use the result in a calculation that would bring us to 68 using the other numbers.
Let's try 95 - 13 first:
This gives us 82. Now we have 14 and we need to find a way to get 68 from these numbers.
Now, let's subtract 14 from 82:
This gives us 68. All the numbers have been used exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 13) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 59, 62, and 16 exactly once such that the final result is 13. Let's explore the different operations now.
First, division and multiplication could potentially be helpful as they would allow us to manipulate the numbers effectively. However, since we are looking for a single outcome of 13, I'll first think about division as it can reduce the magnitude of the numbers.
Let's try using division on 62 and 16. 
62 / 16 = 3.875
This result is not 13, but it's nearby. Now, I'll try subtracting the product of 59 and the result of the division from 13. 
59 * 3.875 = 229.625
Now, subtract this from 13:
13 - 229.625 = -216.625
This also doesn't yield the number 13. Going back to the numbers 59 and 62, if we sum their values:
59 + 62 = 121
Now, let's look at what happens if we use subtraction on these results:
121 - 13 = 108
This doesn't help either. 
What if we look at using 16 in a different way? If we subtract the divisor from the dividend (62 - 46) and then divide by 16, we get:
(62 - 16) / 16 = 46 / 16 = 2.875
Then let's subtract this from our sum of 121:
121 - 2.875 = 118.125
Still not our target. If we take 59 - 16, the result is:
59 - 16 = 43
Then if we divide our target result 13 by this final difference:
13 / (59 - 16) = 13 / 43 = 0.30234...
None of these steps have worked. To figure out the best route, I need to think about using 16 with another arithmetic operation.
16 itself could be used. If I multiply 16 by a number such that when subtracted from 59 that sum, divided by 62 minus a part of 16, we can arrive at 13. 
If I take 43 / 3 = 14.33, the closest integer solution, we would use 43/3 since 16 * 43/3 = 217.33, then:
(59 - 217.33) / 62 = -158.33/62 = -2.563...
However, this does not equal 13.
Playing with these operations more closely, I find:
16 * (59 - 43) / 62 = 16 * 16 / 62 = 256 / 62 ≈ 4.12 
This is not 13 either. 
In revisiting the possibility of division and manipulation:
59 / (62 - 16) = 59 / 46 = 1.28E2-1
I have gone in circles.
Let's assume I use 59 - 62 values:
(59 - 62) / 16 = -3 / 16 = -0.1875
I am close but not there.
(59 - 62 + 16) / 16 = 13 / 16 = 0.8125
Realizing this does not reach my target.
Finally, combining different numbers through steps:
16 + 59 - 62 = 13
This directly equals the number 13 using the combined arithmetic operation.</think>
<answer>(16 + 59 - 62)</answer>

==============
<think> The numbers provided are 92, 50, and 91. We need to generate an equation using these numbers exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that equals 51.
First, let's try combining 91 and 50 since they are close to 51. The difference between 91 and 50 is 41, which seems to be large to possibly reach 51 with 92. However, 91 - 41 = 50.
Next, let's subtract the difference from 92: 92 - 41 = 51.
So, the equation formed would be: 92 - (91 - 50) = 51.
</think>
<answer> 92 - (91 - 50) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 81, 71, and 62. I need to form an equation using each exactly once that equals 90. If I look at the target number, 90, it seems closer to lower numbers, so I might need to subtract or divide. Meanwhile, 81 is the largest number, so it might be good to subtract from it to get closer to 90.
Let's try with 81 - 71 = 10. While 10 is close to 90, we still need the other two numbers to make up 80. Now, I can take 62 and subtract it to reach 90: 81 - 71 - 62 + x = 90. But since we can't use the numbers more than once, we'll adjust this by manipulating our target operation. 
It seems removing 62 from 81 first and then finding another way with 71 and 62 isn't working well. Let's try to use multiplication or division within the steps.
81 * (71 / 62) is approximately 81 * 1. 141 (calculated in mind), which is closer to 90, but the answer is approximately 89, still not exact. However, if we use 81 * (71 / 62) - y = 90, and y = 81 * 1. 141 - 90 = 0. 141, the application of 0. 141 isn't an integer, so this isn't viable.
Lastly, let's try: 81 - 62 + 71 = 90, which satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once.

<answer> 81 - 62 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we are working with - 65, 25, and 78. We need to create an expression that gives us 12.
- One approach could be to use the subtraction operation to adjust one of the values to get closer to 12.
- By considering 78 and 25 first, subtracting 25 from 78 gives us 53.
- Now, we need to use 65, and if we subtract 53 from 65 we will have 12.
- Thus, our equation will be: 65 - 53 = 12.
 </think>
<answer> 65 - (78 - 25) </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 29, and 37. We need an equation that uses these numbers in such a way that the final result equals 77. Observing the numbers, we see that 69 and 29 can be manipulated to get closer to 77.
If we use 69 - 29 = 40, we want to then get 37 closer to the final result of 77. This suggests we could use 40 + 37 = 77. However, we must use the numbers 69, 29 and 37 each exactly once.
Now, let's see if we can build on 69 and 29 directly. One possibility is 69 - 29 = 40, and then find a way to add 37 to reach 77 using the remaining number. We could then add 37 to 40, which indeed gives us 77.
So, the equation using the numbers provided would be: 69 - 29 + 37 = 77.
</think>
<answer>69 - 29 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> I start with the given numbers [69, 29, 37]. I need to combine them using basic arithmetic to reach 77. The number 69 seems the most complex to work with, and 29 and 37 can be potentially combined in various ways to help reach 77.
Let's consider if we can combine 37 and 29 in some way. If we add them, we get: 37 + 29 = 66. Now, we need 11 more to reach 77. If we take 69 - 11, we get 58, which isn't close to what we need.
Instead, let's try multiplying 37 and 29: 37 * 29 = 1073, which is far from 77. That seems unlikely.
Multiplying 69 by either 29 or 37 alone is also not feasible. Given that 69 is significantly larger than 77 and 29 and 37 are not big enough to produce 77, the options to apply operations directly on 69 itself seems the most promising.
Let's re-evaluate with the operations:
If we consider 69 - 29 = 40, then adding 37 to it: 40 + 37 = 77. This gives us a result of 77 successfully! </think>
<answer> 69 - 29 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the number 93 using the numbers 92, 1, 14, 14. Given that 92 is very close to 93, I'll subtract 14 from 92 first. This will give me 78. Next, to get from 78 to 93, I need to add 15. I can form 15 using 14 and 1 by adding these numbers together. So, my equation becomes (92 - 14 + 14). 
Now I'll construct my final equation: (92 - 14) + 14 = 78, then I need to add 15 more to reach 93. So, the final equation to be constructed is (92 - 14) + 14 + 1 = 93. 
Therefore, the equation should be (92 - 14) + 14 + 1.
</think>
<answer>(92 - 14) + 14 + 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I will evaluate the options given the constraints. We have the numbers 3, 16, and 81. The target is 43. Let's first consider multiplication and division, as they can potentially bring us closer to 43 or reduce the disparity between the target and the sum/difference.

Considering division, using 16 or 81 could be useful. If we divide 16 by 4, we get 4, which is close to but not quite 39 (43 - 4 = 39).

Secondly, let's try combinations with the number 3. If we use 81 / 3, we get 27. Now, if we operate on 27 with the remaining number, 16, we can reach 43 with a simple equation: 27 + 16. This succeeds in reaching 43.
</think>
<answer> (81 / 3) + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations that could be useful in making the numbers 32, 70, and 34 combine to give 68. Since these numbers are large and 68 is close to 70, using addition or subtraction might be tricky, so I'll focus on multiplication and division.
Considering some basic divisions, we find that:
70 / 34 is approximately 2.06, which isn't helpful.
But 70 / 32 could be close to 2.19, which resembles 2.25. This seems promising.
So, let's calculate 70 / 32, we get approximately 2.19.
Now we have 2.19 and 34, and we need to get 68.
2.19 * 34 gives approximately 74, which is close to 68.
Therefore, we now need to reduce it by 6, and we can use the number 32.
32 - 6 = 26, but that's too little. 
Let me now try a new combination, adding 34 with 32 should give me 66.
Then, to get 68, I could subtract 2. But 2 is not one of the numbers I have.
A different approach, combining all three: 70 - 34 gives 36, then adding 32 to it gives 68.
So, 70 - 34 + 32 equals 68.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 34 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 16, 91, 49, and 43 exactly once. 
One strategy is to look at subtraction first because 91 - 43 will give us 48, which is close to 81. 
Now we need to achieve the difference of 19 between 91 - 43 = 48 and 81. We can try adding 49 to 48 to make 97 and then subtracting 16 to get 81.
So, the strategy is: (91 - 43 + 49) - 16 = 81. </think>
<answer>(91 - 43 + 49) - 16</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 32, 33, and 41 only once. 
I see that 41 is close to 40, so 41 - 1 will give me 40. 
However, I need a '1' and 41 is not a single number. 
Next, I notice that 41 + 32 = 73 and 73 - 33 = 40. 
So, I'm getting closer, but I need 33 to be -3 instead of +32.
If I invert the whole operation, then -33 + 73 = 40. 
Thus, the equation will be taking the negative of 33 from 41 + 32.
</think>
<answer> (41 + 32) - 33 </answer>
