==============
<think>First, I'll examine the numbers provided: 35, 11, 72. The target number we want to reach is 26.
One approach is to consider if the equation might involve subtraction or division as these operations could bring down the value to the target number. Since 72 exceeds 26, it can't be the result of subtraction, but it could possibly be a divisor in a division problem involving 35 or 11.
Considering division, 35 / 72 is less than one, so it would not help get close to 26. 11 / 72 is similarly too small. However, 72 / 35 is approximately 2.057, which is close to the target number.
Assuming 35 / 72 = x, we have x - 11 = 26, which simplifies to 35 / 72 - 11 = 26. This equation makes logical sense but involves non-integer values, which isn't allowed. </think>
It seems like a subtraction or combination of all operations might be needed. Let's try another approach.
<think> Another idea is to multiply two of the numbers and then subtract or add to get 26. 35 * 11 = 385, which is far from 26. Perhaps 72 * 11 = 792, which is close to 385. However, this doesn't get us to 26.
Next, let's consider: 35 * 11 / 72. This doesn't work since 385 / 72 is approximately 5.36, still far from 26. </think>
Considering a combination like 35 - 11 * 72 / 11 may be necessary. </think>
<think> Calculating 11 * 72 / 11 gives us 72. Then subtracting 35 from 72 sure seems close to 26, as 72 - 35 = 37, which when further adjusted by subtracting 11 becomes close to 26.
So, the equation would be: 72 - 35 - 11 = 26. </think>
</think>
<answer> 72 - 35 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll consider the numbers 73 and 65. If I use subtraction, these could easily get close to 78. Subtracting 65 from 73 gives me 7. Then, I need an additional 71 to reach 78. Of the given numbers, only 86 is large enough to add to 7 to reach 78. Therefore, I can set up the equation 86 - 73 + 65 = 78.
</think>
<answer>86 - 73 + 65</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 59, 32, and 41 that equals 68. Given the constraints, I should first consider how I can manipulate the numbers to get close to 68. One way to do this could be to subtract a number from a larger number, and then add another number to reach 68. </think>
Considering 59 is the largest number and 68 is 9 more than 59, let's start with the equation:
<answer>(59 - 32) + 41</answer>  
- let's calculate this step by step.
<think> Subtracting 32 from 59 first: </think>
<answer>59 - 32 = 27</answer>
<think> Adding 41 to the result from the previous step: </think>
<answer>27 + 41 = 68</answer>
Therefore, the equation that equals 68 using the numbers 59, 32, and 41 is:
<answer>(59 - 32) + 41</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 82, 20, and 17 that results in 85. Each number must be used only once. </think>
I should consider a combination of basic arithmetic operations.
I can start by trying to adjust the sum of the numbers. Adding or subtracting 17 from one of the other numbers might work.
Let's try manipulating 82:
- If I subtract 17, I get 82 - 17 = 65.
- If I add 17, I get 82 + 17 = 99.
Both operations change 82, but still leave me short of 85 for my final result.
Next, let's examine 20:
- I can subtract 20 from 82 to get 62.
- Alternatively, if I add 20 to 17, I get 17 + 20 = 37.
My final number is 17, and it seems adding or subtracting 20 from 82 xchanges the result.
Now, combining 62 (82 - 20) and 17:
- If I add 62 and 17, I get 62 + 17 = 79, which is close but still not 85.
- If I subtract 62 from 17, I get 17 - 62 = -45, which is too far.
Next, let us try swapping the use of numbers around and see if the same logic fits better. I can attempt using 20 in our operations:
- I can subtract 17 from 20 and get 20 - 17 = 3.
- Then, adding 82 and 3 results in 85.
Therefore, I have the equation:
<answer> 82 + (20 - 17) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an expression from the numbers (22, 36, 45) using the operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 31. 
- First, I'll look to see which numbers might be used for subtraction due to 31 being rather close to 45.
- 45 - 22 = 23, which is not close to 31.
- Now, 45 - 36 = 9, which brings me nearer to 31.
- Next, if I subtract 9 from something else, I can get 31.
- One number left is 22, and 9 + 22 = 31!</think>
<answer> (45 - 36) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider that achieving exactly 89 using just the numbers 91, 65, and 63 by employing basic arithmetic operations might be tricky due to their large difference. However, adding and subtracting these numbers directly won't get us close enough to 89. Perhaps multiplication or division could offer a different approach. Let's explore these by combining these numbers in various ways.</think>
Since direct operations don't seem likely to result in 89, let's explore multiplication or division with one of the three numbers as a base.
<think> Looking at the numbers, dividing 91 by 65 gives us approximately 1.4, which is too small, and dividing by 63 gives us around 1.45, also too small. Multiplying 91 by 63 would result in a large number that is not close to 89. The only feasible operation becomes division of 91 by 63, which yields approximately 1.44, which is closer but still not matching our requirement. Let's try rearranging our numbers, combining the numbers and operations differently.</think>
Actually, by combining numbers and operations, if we divide 91 by 63, we can then adjust by adding or subtracting the remainder of the result to get close to 89, but it seems we're still short. Let's think about arranging these numbers in a different order.
<think> Another approach is trying to combine two numbers in a way that might simplify later operations. For instance, adding 65 and 63 before dividing by another number. Doing 65 + 63 = 128, then dividing by 91 would give us approximately 1.41, which is still not correct. However, we did get closer than earlier. We need to find a more precise combination: </think>
By evaluating, I notice that if I were to take 65 + 63, which results in 128, and since the target number is 89, I can then subtract something from 128 to get 89. 128 - 39 equals 89, but 39 cannot be directly formed from the given numbers. Let us consider the numbers and operations appropriately.
Let me revisit this:
<think> Considering the operation with the numbers directly, I can try 91 - (65 - 63) = 91 - 2 = 89. Although we used each number once, this simplification doesn't show directly how we use them. However, the idea of subtracting from a larger number to get a desired result seems correct. Let's check the calculation.</think>
The calculation: 91 - (65 - 63) = 91 - 2 = 89, which does indeed equal 89.
<answer>91 - (65 - 63)</answer>

==============
<think>Since we need to reach 57 using the numbers 81, 17, and 7, and considering the various operations, let’s start by multiplying 81 by a number that will bring us closer to 57 when added or subtracted with the other numbers. Multiplying 81 by 1 will not get us closer to 57, so let's try dividing 81 by 17 or 7.</think>
<think>Dividing 81 by 17 gives us approximately 4.764 (not an exact integer, so it's not likely to be useful). Now, let's consider subtracting 17 and 7 individually from 81 and see if we can get closer to 57.</think>
<think>Subtracting 17 from 81 gives 64, and subtracting 7 from that gives 57, which is exactly what we want. However, we are not allowed to use the 7 or 17 multiple times, and we are only allowed to use once each. So, the equation needs to incorporate subtraction using the numbers, but they can be rearranged.</think>
<think>Given the constraints, instead of considering just 17 and 7 subtracted from 81, let's use the numbers 17 and 7 in a way that both are used once in our equation. We can subtract 7 from 17 first and then subtract that result from 81. That way, we utilize the numbers without repeating any.</think>
<think>Calculating this:
81 - (17 - 7) = 81 - 10 = 71 - This doesn't work since 71 is much higher than 57. So, let's consider if we can alter our strategy by using the numbers in a different order or operation that will result in the number 10 (since 81 - 10 is 71, and if we can get 10 with the numbers 17 and 7, that could work).</think>
<think>17 - 7 = 10. If we subtract 10 from 81, we get 71 again. This doesn't help either, but the idea offers us a new insight: if we subtract 10 from another sum using 17 and 7. Let's try 17 + 7 = 24, then subtract it from 81 to get 57:
81 - (17 + 7) = 81 - 24 = 57. This works.</think>
<answer>81 - (17 + 7)</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider the numbers [95, 18, 58]. Since we need to reach 19, a reasonable first step might be to reduce one of the numbers. 58 seems particularly large compared to 95 and 18, so we might start by subtracting or dividing from 58. Both options are plausible, but dividing would be simpler as a first approach as it could yield a lower number faster. Let's try subtracting from 58. If we subtract 18, we get 40, and then if we subtract 32 more, we get 8. Not 19 but close. Now, if we could get 40, that would be much better. Subtracting 32 from 58 is not possible with the numbers we have, but if we divide, we can achieve 40 (95 - 58), which is not close to 19 either. Let's go back to thinking about adding and subtracting, this time using division as a possibility. Dividing 58 by 2.5 (which is 10.4 in decimal form) might not be feasible, so let's think about another approach with more direct numbers. Context: 58 / 3 = 19.33, and the exact number 19 can be achieved if the division is exact. Dividing 58 by 3 leaves a remainder, so another avenue is needed. Finally, let's think about subtraction. If 95 is used in the subtraction and 58 is reduced by a multiple that results in 19, that could work. 95 - 76 = 19, and 76 = 58 + 18. This works!</think>
<answer>(95 - 58 - 18)</answer>

==============
<think> I see the target is 45, and I have the numbers 46, 27, and 28 available. Let's start by seeing how the numbers can be manipulated to get closer to 45.
First, I observe that 46 is quite large, so we might consider subtracting it to see how we can adjust. Subtracting 28 from 46 gives 18. Now, we need 27 to be used to reach 45 as we get 18 from subtracting 28 from 46.
Let's try combining this with 27. Adding 27 to 18 gives 45. This seems to work, and I have used all the numbers once.</think>
<answer> (46 - 28) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> To get 34 using the numbers 69, 12, 92, and 23, I'll need to utilize a few operations. Since dividing or multiplying by these large numbers wouldn't get me close to 34, I'll try to use subtraction and addition. Considering 34, the closest value to it from the given list is 34 itself or 12, 92, and 23 among these. Using 92 is probably the best approach as 34 is less than 92 and subtracting the rest will give a good outcome. Let's see how close we can get to 34 with 92. </think>
<answer> 92 - 69 - 12 + 23 </answer>
<think> Let's break down the operations inside the equation to verify the result:
1. 92 - 69 = 23
2. 23 - 12 = 11
3. 11 + 23 = 34
This meets the requirement of getting 34 using each number from the given list only once. </think>

==============
<think> First, I need to come up with an equation that uses the numbers 5, 92, and 45 exactly once and equals 42. Given we have three numbers, one way to achieve this is to leverage the operations in such a way that we can manipulate them to reach 42. Let's explore some possibilities:
1. Considering the larger numbers (92 and 45) might simplify quickly, let's try using division, as it can reduce the value efficiently.
2. Multiplying or adding 5 and 92 directly would not get us to 42, so I will look at them only as potential components after division or subtraction.
3. Subtraction seems a good candidate, and I can try subtracting smaller numbers from a larger one. 92 could be broken down with 5 or 45 in some way.
</think>
After some consideration:
<answer>
(92 - 45 - 5)
</answer>
</think>
Let's verify:
- (92 - 45 - 5) = 42, which indeed equals 42.
So the equation using numbers 5, 92, and 45 exactly once, which equals 42, is
<answer>(92 - 45 - 5)</answer>.

==============
<think>First, I need to use the numbers [64, 24, 70] to get the result of 30. Considering I can only use each number once. Let's start by looking at 70 and 24. I can use subtraction or division here. However, 24-70 doesn't give me 30 and dividing 70 by 24 is not close to 30. Next, let's consider multiplication or division with 64. Multiplying 64 by 24 would give a very large number. Dividing by 24 or 64 alone does not help either, as I need to reach exactly 30. </think>
Now, let's examine the possibility of combining 64 and 24 together.
<think>Considering 64-24 = 40 which is too large. Let's try 64/64 = 1 and see if we can get to 30 using this remainder. 64 - 24 = 40; 70 - 40 = 30. Thus, we can use 70 - (64 - 24) = 70 - 40 = 30.</think>
<answer> 70 - (64 - 24) </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, we need to achieve the final result of 87 with the numbers 70, 49, and 66, using basic arithmetic operations and ensuring each number is used only once. 
- Since 87 is almost 89 (which is close to 70 + 49), it seems using subtraction might be the way to go.
- Given 70 and 49, 70 - 49 would result in 21, which is far from 87. 
- Next, consider adding 66 to the result of the subtraction: 21 + 66 = 87. This brings us closer to the target, but we will need to reverse the subtraction to get these numbers.
- Subtracting 66 from 87 gives us the number 21, which we can achieve by subtracting 49 from 70, as 70 - 49 = 21.
- Therefore, we have:
  70 - 49 + 66 = 87. </think>
<answer>70 - 49 + 66</answer>

==============
<think>Firstly, we need to consider how we can use the numbers 94, 20, and 7 to reach the number 67. One effective strategy is to use the number 94 as a base and then adjust with the others. Also, 94 can be manipulated using multiplication or addition with smaller numbers to get close to 67. Let's see if we can achieve the target by manipulating these numbers. Now 20 and 7 are relevant multiples, 20 is close to 67 and 20 can be subtracted from 94, and 7 can be subtracted or added to make the exact calculation. These considerations suggest looking at 94 - 20 or 20 - 7, or a combination of these. </think>
Considering 94, 20, and 7, we can utilize the idea of subtraction from 94 to get a starting point close to our target. Let's try 94 - 20 = 74. Then, we need to get to 67 from 74. We know that 74 - 7 = 67. Therefore, one way to get 67 is subtracting 7 from 94 - 20, or mathematically:
(94 - 20) - 7 = 67. </think>
<answer>(94 - 20) - 7</answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 65, 51, and 17, all exactly once, that equals 99. First, let's consider what kind of operations can yield a specific result. One effective approach is to leverage multiplication and addition/subtraction since they can significantly change the value of numbers.
Now, let's think about the components:
- Multiplying 17 by 65 would give a considerable result, but it's much larger than 99, so we should consider how to use the 51 in our equation.
- 51 is closer to the target value, which suggests using it as an intermediate step.
One possible strategy is to first perform an operation on 17 and 51 that results in a number close to 42 (as 65 + 42 = 107, which isn't exactly 99, but can be modified) and then manage the rest with 51 and 65.
- Subtracting 17 from 51 gives 34.
- Now we need to reach 65 - 34 = 31 from the remaining numbers.
- Subtracting 17 from 65 gives 48, so we are 48 - 17 - 31 = 48 - 48 = 0, which isn't correct yet.
- However, we can consider multiplication here. 65 * 1 = 65, so we need to reduce it to 99 - 65 = 34.
- Now, 65 - 17 * 1 = 65 - 17 = 48, and we need 51 - 48 = 3, which isn't correct.
- Let's rethink: \(65 - 17 + 51 = 99\).
</think>
<answer> (65 - 17) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> We have three numbers: 33, 24, and 97. Our goal is to create an equation where these numbers, using basic arithmetic operations, end up equaling 88. One strategy could be to combine some of these numbers using arithmetic and then subtract or add the remaining number. </think>
Considering the structure, let's try combining the numbers 33 and 24. If we add 33 and 24, we get 57. Now we need another number that, when subtracted from or added to 57, equals 88. Subtracting 57 from 88 gives 31. If we look at the remaining number 97, we realize that 97 - 31 = 66, which isn't the number we're aiming for. 
Let's try another approach: now if we substract 24 from 97, we get 73. If we then subtract 57 (from 33 and 24) from 73, we should get 16, and indeed 73 - 57 = 16. If we now add 16 to 57, we get 73, and finally, subtract this 57 from 88, we get 31. This does not work either since 88 - 57 = 31 is not correct.
Let's try another possible combination: if we take 97 - 33, we get 64. From 64, if we subtract 57, we get 7. At this point, we do not get 88, so let's continue by combining numbers differently.
Since the operation of the equation that gives 88 doesn't seem to be an immediate fit by just adding or subtracting these numbers, maybe we can try multiplication or division.
Considering multiplication and division, we do have the product of 33 and 24, which is 792, which is too large. We need to rethink our approach.
Let's try starting with 97 - 33 = 64. Then we need to work towards 88 using 64 as a basis. If we take 97 - 33 = 64 and try to adjust to get 88 by using other operations, we realize this might not be easily expressible straightforwardly through simple arithmetic operations with the constrained set of numbers.
Instead, we realize a different reconciliation: If we start with 97 - 33 = 64, and then add 24, we get 88. Here is the equation:
<answer> (97 - 33) + 24 </answer>
This equals 88 as required.
</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form a combination of the numbers [4, 32, 2] using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 68. Let's try to use multiplication and addition since we need a high number. 32 is quite a significant number, so it's a good start point. Multiplying it by 2 gives us 64, just short of 68. If I can add 4, then I'll have the exact number. 64 + 4 = 68, which is what we need. </think>
<answer> (32 * 2) + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider which of the basic arithmetic operations are likely to be useful in reaching the number 68 with the numbers 4, 32, and 2. Given the large difference between 4 and 2, multiplication or division seems like the way to go, and given we have 32, addition or subtraction might be useful to close the gap if multiplication is too high. Let's start with the multiplication of 32 and 2, as this will give us 64, which is close to 68.</think>
Now that I've broken down my plan, I'll execute it.
<think> Next, to reach 68 from 64, we need to add 4. This fits with using each number only once, and dividing 4 by itself will give 1, which doesn't help reach 68. Therefore, the final equation will need to include addition.</think>
Time to formulate the equation.
<answer> (32 * 2) + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 52, 87, and 41 using arithmetic operations to get 98. The number 87 is the largest and can likely help us get closer to 98. Let's see how we can use the other numbers around it. One way is to use multiplication because it might fit into our equation as a multiplier. If we use 41 and 2, we get 87. That's just right. This means 87 - 41 = 46. Next, we need 52 to get to 98, so 46 + 52 = 98. The numbers 52 and 41 each appear in the final calculation. </think>
<answer>(87 - 41) + 52</answer>

==============
<think> First, I will consider that one of the arithmetic operations might be needed between 82 and 43. The goal is to reach 89 by using 82, 43, and 50 only once. Let's start by looking at 82 and 43. The difference between these numbers is 39, which seems like a key number that needs to be adjusted to reach 89. Adding 50 to 39 doesn't directly get us to 89. Now, subtracting or dividing doesn't seem to help. I need to add something to get to 89. 39 + 50 is 89! </think>
<answer> (82 - 43) + 50 </answer>

==============
<think> The target is 17 and we are given the numbers 72, 24, 51. 17 is not a large number, so I might be able to use subtraction and division effectively given the numbers we have. Let's try to express 17 as a result of subtraction and division involving the numbers 72, 24, and 51, while each of these numbers is used exactly once in the final expression.
Let's start by trying to see if we can get 17 through some form of subtraction or division. For example, we could subtract 51 from 72 or divide 72 by 51 to get a meaningful number, and then try to manipulate that with 24. Let's start by subtracting 51 from 72 to get 21:
72 - 51 = 21
Now we have 21 and 24. Let's see if we can form 17 using 21 and 24. Tried dividing 24 by 21, which doesn't yield a whole number:
24 / 21 = 1.14...
Before moving on, let's try other combinations to find the right one:
24 - 21 = 3
We ran into a dead end here. Let's return to 21 remaining. Now, we can see if we can manipulate 21 with 24 such that we get 17. If we try to divide 21 by 24, we get a fraction that won't work easily, so let's try the other arithmetic operations.
21 - 24 = -3 doesn't fit our needs either.
If we can't get 17 through subtraction and division, let's try a different approach. Let's try multiplication and division with 24 and 51 first:
51 * 24 = 1224
This is not helpful, as we are producing a larger number than our target.
1224 / 72 = 17
This arrangement works. The multiplication of 51 and 24 gives us 1224, and dividing 1224 by 72 indeed results in 17.
</think>
<answer> (51 * 24) / 72 </answer>

==============
<think>Given the numbers [3, 59, 89], and using each at most once with basic arithmetic operations, we need an equation that equals 10. Let's start by looking at what we can generate using each number.</think>
First, let's consider the number 89. It's a large number, so complex operations will result in it being overshadowed unless it's part of a balanced equation.
<think>Looking at 59, either subtracting or adding it to 89 or 3 might not bring us directly to 10. Let's go through the basics:</think>
<think>Now let's take the number 3. Multiplying 3 by 3 gives us 9, close to 10, and then subtracting 1 could give us 8, subtracting 2 more yields 6, and continuing this logic suggest an additional decrement of 4 would make 10. However, this introduces new numbers again and makes it complex quickly.</think>
<think>Another way to consider is if we could use division. Since 89 and 59 are large, using them as divisors might not yield a simple solution quickly. But one can consider the division of 59 by 3 as approximately 19.67, which isn't 10. </think>
<think>Therefore, we are left with 89 and 59 as parts that do not quite combine to make 10 directly, and 3 seems to be a more feasible candidate for addition, subtraction or division that might lead to 10.</think>
<think>The one operation I haven't fully explored yet is the subtraction of smaller parts to fit 10. 59 is too large of a number, while 3 is close in magnitude to 10 when added or subtracted from 89 in an innovative way.</think>
<think>Exploring the possibility of 89 - 59, we get 29. If we subtract this 29 from 10, we get -19, which doesn't help. However, considering variations of operations on these values might be better.</think>
<think>Now, if we consider 59 - 3, we get 56. Subtracting 56 from 89 leaves us with 33, not helping. Next, let's try to devise basic operations.</think>
<answer>(89 - 59) / 3</answer>
<think>The equation (89 - 59) / 3 simplifies to 30 / 3 which equals 10. We're not using all numbers but the equation forms correctly adhering to the constraints. </think>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how the numbers 6, 40, and 26 can be manipulated using basic arithmetic operations to make a result of 20. Since 40 is quite large and 26 is closer to 20, I might consider using subtraction to get closer to 20. Let's see what happens if I subtract 26 from 40. That would give me 14. Now, to get from 14 to 20, I need to add 6. So the equation could be 40 - 26 + 6. Let's check if this works.
</think>
<answer> (40 - 26) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should check if the numbers or their combinations using simple operations could result in 34. I notice that 68 and 2 when divided, give 34 (68 / 2 = 34), but 17 can't be used in the equation. Also, 17 can be used in a subtraction or addition that could work with 68. Let's check both:</think>
<answer> 68 - 17 * 2 </answer>
<think> Using the multiplication and subtraction:
1. Multiplying 17 * 2 = 34
2. Then subtracting 34 from 68 gives:
68 - 34 = 34
This satisfies the requirement of the equation to equal 34 with the given numbers and operations.</think>

==============
<think> I need to use the given numbers 49, 51, and 33 exactly once and use basic arithmetic operations to get 31. 
First, let's take a look at what we can do with the 3 numbers we have. 
The first number 51 is quite large and the last number 33 is quite small. 33 is a factor of 51, so something like 51 - 33 can be a way to get a manageable number.
If I subtract 33 from 51 first, I get 18. Now I need to use 49 and how can 18 + 49 give us 31.
Let me check if 18 + 49 equals 31. 18 + 49 = 67, which is clearly not 31.
So, instead of adding, let's consider substraction. If I subtract 18 from 33, I get 15. Now, we need 6 more to get 31.
One way to get 6 from 49 is by subtracting 43 from it, but 43 is not among the numbers we can use. 
Let me re-check with multiplication and division: 
1) Multiplying 33 with 49 gives 1617 which is too high.
2) Dividing 51 by 18 is around 2.8 which is not helpful in making 31.
3) Dividing 49 by 18 is approximately 2.72 which still doesn't help.
So, let's try another way. I realize now that given the target 31, I should take a different route. 
The best strategy now seems to be making use of 33 first. 
33 is pretty close to 31, so let's try what happens if I add 49 and then subtract 33. That is: (49 + 33) - 51.
Let's calculate this:
49 + 33 = 82
Now, 82 - 51 will give us 31.
Therefore, we have: <answer> (49 + 33) - 51 </answer>.
</think>

==============
<think>Given the numbers [32, 31, 32], we need to create an equation that equals 33 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by considering how we might approach the equation. The difference between 33 and 31 is just 2, meaning if any number can be subtracted by 2 or added by 2, it could help in reaching 33. Of course, 32 divided by 2 equals 16, yet we haven't used all numbers or considered other operations. The number 32 has a significant value and if we could use addition or subtraction, it could be helpful with the others. Let's try to manipulate 32 in such a way.</think>
<answer>(32 - 31) + 32</answer>
</think>
Let's verify this calculation:
- The subtraction 32 - 31 gives us 1,
- Adding this to 32 yields 33. 
Therefore, the equation <answer>(32 - 31) + 32</answer> equals 33 using the provided numbers exactly once.

==============
<think> Given numbers are 98, 29, 2, and 1. We can use the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get the result 67. The number 1 will remain in all operations since subtraction will make the number smaller and multiplication will make the number closer to 67. Starting with the large number, 98, subtracting all available numbers may push the sum very far. However, combining the smaller numbers in different operations might help. Let's see.</think>
We need to get 67 from the combination of these numbers. Let's try combinations:
<think> The first thought is to combine the smaller numbers to get close to 67. We could try (29 + 2) * 2, but that equals 62, which isn't quite right. Adding 1 to that gets us to 63, still not 67. Now, let's try some other possibilities.</think>
After trying different combinations, let's test (98 - 29 - 2) * 1.
<think> This simplifies to (69 - 2) * 1, which calculates to 67. Using 1 in the last step is purely for the mathematical equation, ensuring each number is used once and the operations are correctly applied.</think>
<answer>(98 - 29 - 2) * 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll evaluate the simplest combination of operations that might result in 28. One likely approach is to use multiplication and addition or subtraction in a clever way.
Considering the numbers given, 36 and 33 are the highest numbers, so one might think about using multiplication, but 36*33 doesn't reach 28. 
6 and 19 are smaller numbers which, when multiplied together, give 114. Similarly, subtracting or adding these numbers will not immediately result in 28.
33 can be subtracted from 36 to get 3: 36 - 33 = 3, which is a small difference.
If I use 6, which is relatively small, could 6 be part of the multiplication or could it be subtracted or added to other numbers?
6 could be part of 6*5 = 30, which is close to 28 and gives a good base. But we only have 3 left and adding 3 to or subtracting from our result doesn't yield 28.
I'll focus on the operations with 19 and 33. Since 33 > 19, doing something with these will be key.
I can try 33 - 19 = 14 and then add 6 to get closer to 28.
However, to get exactly 28, we need 6 + 14 to be 20. Adjusting 14 to get 20 by adding 6 still leaves us needing to reach 14, not 20.
So, 36 - 33 = 3 and then adding 6, 19, and the remaining 3 to reach 28 seems promising. However, I need to fit 36 - 33 = 3 into 20 + n = 28.
The solution appears to be: 19 + 6 + (36 - 33) = 28.
</think>
<answer> 19 + 6 + (36 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> To get 95 using the numbers 51, 69, and 77 with basic arithmetic operations only once each, I need to consider all possible operations and combinations.
I can consider each number as a potential starting point for an equation and check if the result using the remaining numbers is close to 95.
Let's start with 77:
1. Adding 69 and 51 gives 120, which is too high.
2. Subtracting 69 from 77 gives 8, which is not ideal.
3. Subtracting 51 from 77 gives 26, which is not near 95.
Now, let's try starting with 69:
1. Adding 77 and 51 gives 128, which is too high.
2. Subtracting 77 from 69 gives -9, which is not ideal.
3. Subtracting 51 from 69 gives 18, which is not near 95.
Finally, let's try starting with 51:
1. Adding 69 and 77 gives 146, which is too high.
2. Subtracting 69 from 51 gives -18, which is not ideal.
3. Subtracting 77 from 51 gives -26, which is not ideal.
It seems none of the combinations with basic arithmetic operations directly yield 95. Let's try combining operations.
Considering combinations:
- 77 + 69 - 51 = 95, which directly uses all numbers once and equals 95.
</think>
<answer> 77 + 69 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if any of the numbers are close enough to 62 to be subtracted from (or added to) another number to get 62. Then I'll think about possible operations like multiplying or dividing.
Let's start with the number 74. It's the largest number. If I subtract 12 from 74, I get 62. So, 74 - 12 = 62.
Now I need to represent 12 using the remaining numbers 73 and 61. I see that 73 - 61 = 12.
So, if I use the numbers 73, 61, and 74, I can express 62 as 74 - (73 - 61).
</think>
<answer>74 - (73 - 61)</answer>

==============
<think> To get 40 using the numbers 19, 20, and 21 with basic arithmetic operations and each used only once, let's start by looking at the numbers and their possible combinations.
We should consider if we can use any combination of arithmetic operations that can sum up to our target of 40.
Multiplying and adding them gives 19*20 - 21 = 380 - 21 = 359 which is too high.
Dividing and subtracting them gives 21 - 19/20 = 21 - 0. 95 = 20. 05 which is also not 40.
Adding and then subtracting doesn't seem to produce 40 either.
Now, let's try using subtraction and addition first:
21 - 19 + 20 = 2 + 20 = 22.
22 is close to our target but still needs 18 more. 
Multiplying the remaining number by 9 doesn't get us there.
Subtracting and then adding might not work because we use each number only once.
So, need to rethink to simplify. Notice that 20 - 19 = 1, and since 21 - 1 = 20, let's try to combine those.
(21 - 19) * 20 = 2 * 20 = 40. Thus, the equation works.
</think>
<answer>(21 - 19) * 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I will consider how I can use the numbers 12 and 80 without exceeding the target of 89. Adding or subtracting these numbers directly won't get us to 89. Multiplication of 12 or 80 could be helpful, but using 80 directly will likely exceed it. 

Now, looking at 21, it seems like a key. It can isolate or be added to or subtracted from 80 to get closer to 89. 

Let's consider: 

- If we add 21 to 80, we get 101, which is too high. 
- If we subtract 21 from 80, we get 59, which is close but still not 89. 

Then, I'll see if 12 can play a part:

- If I subtract 12 from 59, I'll have 47, still far from 89.
- But if I add 12 to 59, I get 71, which is dissatisfying. 

So, let’s think differently:

- What if I add 21 to 12, we would get 33, and then add that to 80, we would still be short of getting to 89.
  
- If I then add 12, we would get 33 + 12 = 45, which is still not the target.

So, considering these, I'll add another component:

- Adding 21 to the result of (12 + 80/12) would give me closer to 89.

Let's break down the calculation:
- Calculate 80 / 12, which equals 6.6667 (or 6 and 2/3).
- Add this to 12, giving us 12 + 6.6667 = 18.6667.
- Now, adding 21 to 18.6667 gives us 18.6667 + 21 = 39.6667.
- Finally, add this to 50 which is the closest integer to the target of 89, giving 39.6667 + 50 = 89.6667, which is almost 89, but slightly over.
  
Therefore 12 + (80 / 12) + 21 is close to our desired result but not exactly. We need to adjust one step to get the exact result:
  
- Consider direct: 80 - 12 + 21 = 89.

Let's confirm this:
- Start with 80 - 12 = 68. 
- Then add 21 to get 80 - 12 + 21 = 80 - 12 + 21 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 12 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how the numbers 24 and 73 can be manipulated to equal 24 using the allowed arithmetic operations and with the numbers available only once. Starting with the 73, I can attempt to subtract the 24 to get 49. Now, I need to get from 49 to 24 using the number 25. Subtracting 25 from 49 will give me 24. So, the equation becomes 73 - 25 - 24 equals 24. It's important to keep in mind that this can be rearranged to use the 25 in a different way. </think>
<answer> 73 - 25 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the number 26 using the numbers 37, 61, and 72, we need to think about all possible operations and see if we can construct the target number. We can start by examining what we get when we use each number in isolation with the different operations and see if we can get close to 26.
The smallest number is 37. Subtracting or dividing it will not help much as we move away from 26. Adding or multiplying 37 to the other numbers is also not feasible.
Next, consider the number 61. It is too large by itself and does not produce 26 by itself or when paired with 37 or 72 through any operation.
Finally, the number 72. Aiming to use its properties, we find that dividing 72 by 3 gives us 24, close to 26. This suggests we may need to add/subtract a small amount to reach 26.
Considering all this, we aim to reduce 24 to make it 26 by using 37 and 61. Considering the options, subtracting 61 from 72 and then subtracting the result from 37 seems promising.
</think>
<answer> (37 - (72 - 61)) </answer>

==============
<think> We need an equation using the numbers 65, 41, and 18 that equals 88, using basic arithmetic operations and each number exactly once. 

First, observe that 65 and 18 are quite far from 88. Therefore, using subtraction or division with these two numbers may not bring us to 88 easily.

The sum of all three numbers is 65 + 41 + 18 = 124. This is too large for division, and subtracting 18 from 65 or 41 doesn't bring us as close to 88 as an addition would.

Next, consider an addition that combines two of these numbers and subtracts the third:
- 65 + 41 - 18 = 88

This combination meets all the conditions: we used all three numbers once, and the calculation yields 88.
</think>
<answer> (65 + 41) - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 93, 20, and 26 to get 47. 93 is already quite large, so it likely won't be the result of any operation involving all the numbers. 
Considering all the operations, addition and subtraction could potentially adjust the sum of the numbers to 47. I will check all possible combinations from these three numbers using addition and subtraction:
- Adding all three numbers: 93 + 20 + 26 = 139
- Subtracting numbers: 
  - Subtracting 93: 93 - 20 - 26 = 47
  - Subtracting 20: 93 - 20 - 26 = 47
  - Subtracting 26: 93 - 20 - 26 = 47
</think>
<answer>93 - 20 - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 81 using the numbers 37, 84, and 40, we need to consider how we can manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations. The number 84 is the largest, so we could try to use it as a multiplier or add it in some way, but it seems to be too large directly to get to 81. Number 40 seems like a good candidate for subtraction since it would leave us with a manageable number to use the other numbers with. Let's see if we can make use of 37 in the equation.
Considering multiplication or division involving 84 and the other numbers doesn't seem promising since 84 and the other numbers don't give us a number close to 81. So, subtraction seems the most feasible option involving 40. If we subtract 40 from 84, we get 44. Now we need 37 to reach 81 by the end. So, 44 + 37 = 81. This looks promising.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 40) + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to look at the numbers provided: 7, 85, 67, 60. The number 85 is significantly larger, so I might need to use subtraction to make use of it. The target is 35, which is close to 67 but less than 85.
The operation that can reduce 85 close to 35 involves subtraction, specifically 85 - something.
Considering the remaining numbers 7, 67, 60, let's see how they can help.
Let's try to use subtraction first. If I subtract 67 from 85, I get the number 18. 18 is still not 35, so I need to adjust this. Adding or subtracting 7 (the next available number) might help.
Let's try: 85 - 67 + 7 = 25
This is still not 35. Now, I need to make 25 into 35. To get 10 more, adding 7 won't work, as that's what I already have. So instead, let's try using 60, which can be useful in combination with the 7 to get 35.
Notice that 35 is close to 60 - 25. 25 is exactly what I got from 85 - 67 + 7, so 60 - (85 - 67 + 7) would give me 35.
The calculation would then be: 60 - (85 - 67 + 7) = 60 - 25 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 60 - (85 - 67 + 7) </answer>

==============
<think> To get 93 using the numbers 75, 49, and 67 exactly once, we could try combining them in various ways with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
1) Consider the difference of two numbers could result in 93, as 75 - 49 = 26, which isn't 93.
2) Seeing that the direct difference doesn't work, let's try adding and subtracting. If we take the sum of 75 and 67, we get 142, which is too large as it's far from 93. If we subtract 49 from 142, we get 93, but we would use 49 twice.
3) Let's try another method. Since 93 - 75 = 18, we might use 18 with another number from the list. If we were to use 49 and 67 with an operation on one of them, dividing 49 by 7 (simplified from 75/17) could give us 7, and then 49 - 7 = 42, but that's still far from 93. 
4) Trying 67 - 49 gives us 18. But if we add 75 and 18, we get 93. 
We've found a combination. Let's create the equation.
</think>
<answer> 75 + (67 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider the numbers [59, 76, 41] and the target number 24. One effective approach might be to use the 59 and 41 first, as they sum up to 100, which then can be adjusted with the 76 to get 24. 
59 + 41 = 100, and we need to adjust this to get 24.
100 - 76 = 24, which is exactly what we need.
To confirm the steps:
59 + 41 = 100
100 - 76 = 24
So the equation is (59 + 41) - 76 = 24.
</think>
<answer>(59 + 41) - 76</answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I need to create an equation using the provided numbers that equals 59, and each number can be used only once. The numbers given are: 91, 41, 17, and 56. One way to start is to try to multiply or divide to get a number close to 59, as these operations can help us simplify the problem.
If I divide 91 by the smallest number (17), I get 5.35, which is close to 5.9 and helps me get close to 59. However, since I need to get an exact 59, let's try adding and subtracting the remaining numbers (41 and 56) to whatever we get from the division.
Let's divide 91 by 17 and then add 41 and subtract 56. That would effectively be (91/17) + 41 - 56.
Calculating the values step by step:
(91 / 17) = 5.35
5.35 + 41 = 46.35
46.35 - 56 = -9.65
This is not a valid answer as 59 is not -9.65. 
Let's try another approach by subtracting smaller numbers from the total.
If I subtract 56 from 91, I get 35, and if I then add 41, I get 76, which is too big. Let's try adding smaller numbers to reach 59.
Adding 17 to 35 gives me 52. Adding 7 more to reach 59. The 7 can be obtained from subtracting 56 from 41.
So, (91 - 56) + (41 - 56 + 17) = 35 + (-4) = 31, which is still near 59. Let's try a different way:
(91 - 56) + (41 - 17) = 35 + 24 = 59
This equation works as 35 + 24 = 59, using all the numbers provided once. </think>
<answer>(91 - 56) + (41 - 17)</answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the target of 97 using the numbers 66, 24, and 55, I need to start with an operation that will bring us closer to 97. If I use subtraction or addition, I'll need to consider multiplication or division as well, since the numbers 66 and 55 are larger and thus will have a significant impact. 
Looking at the numbers, let's consider a combination where multiplication and addition could work together. Using the largest number, 66, could help reach 97.
66 * 2 + 9 = 132 + 9 = 141, which is too big.
Let's try 66 * 1 + 9 = 75, which is still too big. Multiplying by a smaller number or using addition with a larger number doesn't seem to be feasible with 24 or 55 as the remaining number.
Let's try using 24 instead of 2 as the multiplier: 
66 * 24 + x = 97, so 
x = 97 - 66 * 24, 
x = 97 - 1584, 
x = -1487.
Clearly, using multiplication by 24 and subtraction by 66*24 doesn't work either.
Now let's try to calculate using division and subtraction:
66 - 24 = 42,
Now, I need to make this 42 equal to 97 using one remaining number. 
42 + 55 = 97, which works!
So, the final equation should be 66 - 24 + 55 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 24 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> To arrive at 68 using the numbers 16, 92, and 8, I need to figure out how to manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations. One quick idea is to see if any combination of the numbers could add up to 68. Let's try the first number, 16, subtract it from 92:
92 - 16 = 76
Now we have 76 and 8. The next step would be to modify these numbers to get close to 68. 76 and 8 can be manipulated by division or subtraction. If we try dividing 76 by 8, we get:
76 / 8 = 9.5
This is not 68, but it's close. We just need to reach 68 and we should be able to do that with subtraction and adjustment. 76 - 8 = 68
Thus, the equation is:
92 - 16 - 8 = 68
</think>
<answer> 92 - 16 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> My goal is to create an equation with the numbers 36, 46, and 39 using basic arithmetic operations such that the result equals 49. Let's try some combinations by combining and manipulating the numbers:
1. First, let's see if I can get 49 by adding or subtracting these numbers in any possible way:
   - 36 + 46 = 82, which is more than 49
   - 36 + 39 = 75, which is still more than 49
   - 46 + 39 = 85, which is more than 49
   - 39 + 46 - 36 = 49. This successfully results in 49!
Since 49 = 39 + 46 - 36, the numbers fit the criteria. </think>
<answer>39 + 46 - 36</answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by considering possible combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to see if I can get close to 55 using the numbers 49, 97, 18, and 11. 

First, if we use 97 - 49 = 48, but we're still missing 5, to get to 55.
Next, 48 + 11 = 59, which is close to 55 and positive, so let's consider if we can adjust this. 

Then, 59 - 4 = 55, but we can't use 4 as we're only allowed to use each number once and we don't have a 4 available in the list.

But, consider the operation 49 - 18 = 31. Now, I have 31 and need 24 more to reach 55.

Next, if I have 97 - 11 = 86, I can then use 86 - 31 = 55 (as 86 - 31 is 55).

So, we can create the equation as follows:
<answer>(97 - 11) - (49 - 18)</answer> which equals 55.
</think>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 16, 55, and 61 to form an equation that equals 10. The numbers should be used exactly once. 
First, I will consider all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. Since 10 is a small target number, I might look for a combination of numbers through a combination of addition and subtraction or possibly multiplication and division.
- If I consider multiplication and division, I can see that 61 is quite large and division by 61 would result in a very small number, and 16 and 55 would not help in achieving 10.
- If I consider addition and subtraction, I notice that 61 is quite large and subtracting 55 from 16 or 61 from 16 or 55 from 16 would overshoot or undershoot 10. Therefore, a mix of these operations might not provide a solution.
- Given the other options, it seems the only feasible method involves one operation to reduce the numbers.
Therefore, I will consider if subtraction or division could be the best approach since multiplication tends to increase the number significantly.
Upon closer examination, let's try the equation \(61 - 55 - 16\). We can easily check the arithmetic:
\(61 - 55 = 6\)
\(6 - 16 = -10\)
This equation doesn't work since it gives -10. Let's reconfigure it:
\(55 - 16 = 39\)
\(61 - 39 = 22\) which doesn't equal 10. 
Another configuration:
\(61 - (55 + 16)\) doesn't work as 61 - 71 = -10.
To get to 10:
\(16 - (55 - 61) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20\), which is far from 10.
Finally, it seems the only feasible way involves a combination of adding and subtracting or using an unsupported combination of arithmetic operations:
\(55 - (61 - 16) = 55 - 45 = 10\).
</think>
<answer>55 - (61 - 16)</answer>

==============
<think> To get from 77 using the numbers 43, 7, and 32 with basic arithmetic operations, we should consider the order of numbers and try to maximize or minimize values. One approach could be combining smaller numbers with a basic operation to reach closer to the target value of 77. 
Since 32 is the closest to 77, let's see if we can modify other numbers to close the gap.
If we consider the number 43, if we take 43 - 32 we get 11. This is not directly where we want to go, so we try to combine this with 7 and 32. 
Given that 7 has the smallest magnitude and needs to be combined with additions or multiplies to reach a significant gap, let's see if we can use 7:
We'll use 43 - 32 = 11 and then find a way to add or multiply 11 to get closer to 77.
Now, 7 * 11 = 77 which is the target number. 
So, the equation would be (43 - 32) * 7 = 77. </think>
<answer>(43 - 32) * 7</answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 20, 59, and 67 to create an equation that equals 28. We'll try to use available arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /. Each number can only be used once.
We could consider creating an equation that involves subtraction and division. One way to simplify 28 is by making combinations smaller numbers from the provided list.
Considering 59 is the highest number, subtracting it with another number should not work in this case.
However, we notice that 20 + 67 = 87 is a large number, so it won't yield 28 either.
An alternative approach could be to consider dividing 59 by a number and then subtracting it from 20, but that also seems unlikely.
Another way to see it is to first check simple multiplications or divisions that yield a number close to 28 with one of the other two numbers.
When we consider division, 59 ÷ 2 equals 29.5, not 28, but it's close.
Then when we consider what could be subtracted from 20 to get 28, we can see that 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5, which is very close to 28. Subtracting 1 from 29.5 gives us 28.5, which is still off, but we can round down.
So, let's see if we can adjust to get closer, which might involve using the division and subtraction in a different way than initially considered.
67 - 59 = 8. Then dividing this result by 2 (67 ÷ 2 = 33. 5) and then subtracting 56 (i.e., 20 - (33. 5)) from 20 gives us the result 28.
This means: 20 - (33. 5 - 59 ÷ 2) = 20 - (33. 5 - 29. 5) = 20 - 4 = 16.
This does not work, so let's check for simpler possibilities.
Another attempt with the numbers: 20 - (59 - 67) = 20 - (-8) = 20 + 8 = 28.
</think>
<answer> 20 - (59 - 67) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 52, 19, and 5 with each number only used once and basic arithmetic operations, I'll go through each operation to see what combination works.

First, I notice that 52 is the largest number, so it might be a good start point to subtract from or divide by in order to get closer to 38.

1. If I subtract 52 by 19, I get 33 which is closer to 38. Adding the 5 should help me reach 38.
2. Multiplying 52 by other numbers doesn't seem feasible considering the target is 38.
3. Dividing 52 by numbers other than 5 and 19 might result in decimals, which may not fit the format we need.

From these steps, it seems subtracting 19 and then adding 5 should be a viable operation.
</think>
<answer> (52 - 19) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to evaluate the options provided with the numbers 5, 3, and 27. Considering the target result is 76, the multiplication of 27 could be a good option, as it's the largest number.
Now, if I multiply 27 by 3, I would get 81. To reach 76 from here, I can use the remaining number, 5, and subtract 5 from 81.
So, the equation would be: 
27 * 3 - 5 = 76.
Since both the 27 and 3 are used, using the number 5 twice is not allowed. Hence, the above solution is feasible.</think>
<answer> 27 * 3 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 76 using the numbers 5, 3, and 27 with basic arithmetic operations, we need to strategically use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's notice that 27 is a significant value to work with, so we might consider incorporating it using other numbers. We have 27 and we also have 5, which might help us get a number close to 76 by multiplication.
Let's try to form the number 28 first because it's close to 76 and can be achieved by 27 - 9, which would require using 9. However, 9 is not one of the numbers we have. 
Let's try increasing 27. We can form 27 * 3 = 81. This is slightly over 76. If we subtract one, we would get 76. We have 5 available, so if we subtract 5 from our 27 * 3, we can get the answer.
The equation would therefore be: 27 * 3 - 5 = 76.
</think>
<answer>27 * 3 - 5</answer>

==============
<think> To get 82 using the numbers [5, 59, 28], we should consider the operations that could lead to this sum. Given that we can't get 82 directly with simple additions and subtractions, we should try to manipulate 59 and 28 into an approximate form that we can adjust with 5.
First, let's perform 59 + 28 = 87.
This is close to 82, but we need to reduce it by 5.
We have the number 5 available which we can subtract from 87 to achieve 82.
Thus the equation using the numbers [5, 59, 28] to reach 82 is:
(59 + 28) - 5 = 82
</think>
<answer>(59 + 28) - 5</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 75, 27, and 1 to reach 48. 
One approach is to manipulate the numbers with basic arithmetic operations to see if we can get to the target value.
If we look at the numbers, the 75 seems like it could be broken down or combined in some way. It's divisible by 3 (75 / 3 = 25). Additionally, 27 can be used in combination with 1.
Let's test the feasibility of this approach with an equation.
(75 / 3) + 27 + 1
Calculating each part:
75 / 3 = 25
25 + 27 = 52
52 + 1 = 53
That's not quite 48, so we need to reconsider. 
Let's try another possibility:
(75 - 27) * 1 + some adjustment
Let's explore this further:
(75 - 27) * 1 = 48
Adding 1 does not seem necessary here, as we already get 48. 
If 48 is what we are looking for, then 75 - 27 = 48, which is correct.
So the equation is (75 - 27) * 1 = 48.
</think>
<answer>(75 - 27) * 1</answer>

==============
<think> We need an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 25, 9, 78, and 6 only once. 
Starting with the larger number 78, it's quite close to 68. If we could somehow reduce 78, we would be on the right path. 
Given the remaining numbers 25, 9, and 6, we can consider subtraction, since we need to reduce 78.
If we subtract 25 from 78, we get 53. We need to get from 53 to 68, so we need 15 more.
15 can be derived by adding 9 and 6 together. Thus, the equation would look like:
78 - 25 + 9 + 6 = 68.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 25 + 9 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will consider simple combinations of the numbers 44, 75, and 64 with addition and subtraction, since these are the basic operations that can balance each other out.
- Substituting different numbers to see possible sums or differences, starting with 44 and 75:
  - 75 - 44 = 31, which is not 55 
  - 44 + 75 = 119, which is not 55
- Numerically, adding or subtracting directly does not yield 55. Now, let's try multiplication or division:
  - Considering division: 75 / 64 = 1.171875, which isn't 55, and 64 / 75 = 0.8533, also doesn't give us 55.
  - For multiplication: 44 * 75 = 3300, which isn't 55. 44 * 64 = 2816, again not 55.
- Based on these initial checks, other operations might be needed. Now, let's consider addition and subtraction combined:
  - 75 - 44 + 64 = 31 + 64 = 95
  - Clearly, this is still not 55
  - Now let's consider 75 + 44 - 64 = 119 - 64 = 55
This confirms that the combination of addition and subtraction is viable. </think>
<answer> 75 + 44 - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> I have the numbers 33, 2, and 91 to work with. I need to create an equation that equals 56. Let's consider the possibility of using subtraction, because subtracting 91 from 33 would result in a large negative number, which might be difficult to reach 56 from. Using 2 could be useful for precision as a smaller adjustment. 
First, I'll try subtracting 91 from 33. Since 33 is smaller than 91, let's try the reverse subtraction, 91 - 33 = 58. 
Next, to get from 58 to 56, I need to subtract 2.
So, the resulting equation will be 91 - 33 - 2 = 56.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 33 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers [3, 92, 57] that equals 38, I need to consider how I can incorporate each number in a way to get the desired result. I'll start with the basic arithmetic operations to see what's possible. Notice that 92 and 57 are quite far from 38, so subtracting one from the other doesn't seem to get us close. Also, dividing and multiplying doesn't seem to help significantly either.
The number 3, however, is a good candidate because it’s small and could be crucial when combined with other numbers.
If we look at 92 - 57 = 35, this is quite close to the target. But we still need to get to 38. Adding 3 to 35 would give us 38, which seems to be the idea. 
Therefore, if we combine 92 - 57 = 35 with 35 + 3 = 38, we’ve found our equation. We're only using each of the numbers once and it satisfies the condition. </think>
<answer>(92 - 57) + 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's start by considering the basic arithmetic operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
I'm going to experiment with different combinations using the three numbers [21, 49, 90] each only once.
One strategy is to see if we can combine them using addition and subtraction to achieve the target number 20.
I'll try: 90 - 49 - 21. This gives:
90 - 49 = 41
41 - 21 = 20
So this gives us the target number 20.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 49) - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, let's analyze the numbers we have: 54, 25, and 69. The target is to get 10.
We need to use all three numbers only once. Let's consider the order and combination of operation signs to potentially reach our target.
Taking 54 and 69, we might use subtraction: 54 - 69 = -15. This brings us closer to our goal of 10.
Now, we are left with 25 and -15. We can think about using addition to get to 10 starting from -15: 25 + (-15) = 10.
Therefore, using this logic we create our equation step by step: we first subtract 69 from 54, then add 25 to the result. Making the final equation (54 - 69) + 25 = 10.
</think>
<answer> (54 - 69) + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers [10, 1, 12] exactly once to produce the answer 22. Let's try different combinations with the available arithmetic operations.
- We can try addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- We can also consider possible groupings or functions (like parenthesizing the numbers and operations) to achieve the result.
We can set up the numbers as follows:
(10 + 12) / 1
Let's calculate the left side first: (10 + 12) gives us 22.
Then, divide 22 by 1: 22 / 1 = 22.
Since the equation results in 22, it satisfies our condition.
So the equation that meets all the criteria is: (10 + 12) / 1.
</think>
<answer>(10 + 12) / 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, we observe that we need to reach the number 65 using the numbers 12, 53, 1, and 24. Seeing that 53 is relatively larger, we should consider how we can make use of it. One way is to manipulate 53 such that it gets closer to 65. Subtracting 12 from 53 gives us 41. Now, we have 41 and 1. We lack a number around 24, so we might think about division or subtraction, but these operations seem less direct with the numbers available now. 
The number 24 is significant since it's close to 65 - 41 = 24. That could mean dividing. So, if we divide 24 by 1 (since 1 can only be used once), we get 24. Then, adding 24 to 41 will give us 65. Thus, the equation becomes: (53 - 12) / 1 + 24 = 65.
</think>
<answer>(53 - 12) / 1 + 24</answer>

==============
<think> Taking the numbers provided [69, 48, 64], we need to use these along with basic arithmetic operations to get the result 85. First, it's useful to observe the magnitude of these numbers, as 69 and 64 are closer to the target number 85 than 48 is. Therefore, we can consider combining 69 and 64 in some way.
69 + 64 is 133, which is greater than 85. Subtracting 48 from 69 or 64 might get us closer to 85.
69 - 48 = 21
If we use 21 now, we need an addition of 64 to get 85, as 21 + 64 does not work.
Therefore, a good equation should be starting with 69 - 48 and then adding 64.
</think>
<answer> (69 - 48) + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> Given the numbers 39, 29, and 73, we aim to create an equation that equals 63 using basic arithmetic operations. 
To get close to 63, let's first think about possible additions or subtractions. 
One approach is to think about how we can make use of 73 to get as close as possible to 63, since 73 - 10 = 63. 
However, we don't have 10 as a number in our list. Looking at the other numbers, we find that 39 - 29 = 10. 
Thus, we can use this operation: 73 - (39 - 29) = 73 - 10 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 73 - (39 - 29) </answer>

==============
<think> We are provided with the numbers 33, 55, and 55, and we need to form an equation that equals 77 by using basic arithmetic operations. 
We start by considering the combination of numbers. Notice that 55 + 55 equals 110. This might help us subtract from it. 
55 + 55 = 110
Now we subtract 33 from 110.
110 - 33 = 77
So we have our equation: (55 + 55) - 33 equals 77.
</think>
<answer>(55 + 55) - 33</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 20, 46, and 31 that equals 35, we can start by looking at what operations could make sense with these numbers. A key operation here is subtraction, as we can potentially make a larger number smaller in a meaningful way.
Let's consider 46 - 31: This gives us 15. Now, we need another number to combine with 15 to get 35. 
15 + 20 equals 35. So, the equation combining all three numbers, using subtraction and addition, is 46 - 31 + 20 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 46 - 31 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 78, 98, and 62 which results in 82. A good starting point is to see if we can get close to 82 by combining some of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
Considering 78 is the smallest number and 98 is the largest, a possible approach could be to use these to get closer to 82, and then adjust with the third number.
98 + 62 = 160 and this is too large. So, we need to make a 160 closer to 82. Let's subtract a smaller number from 160.
160 - 78 = 82
Thus, the equation appears to be 98 + 62 - 78 = 82.
</think>
<answer>98 + 62 - 78</answer>

==============
<think> First I'll consider the structure of the equation and the numbers given. We need to achieve 44 using the numbers 7, 2, and 53. Since these numbers are not easily manipulated to get 44 using simple arithmetic operations, I'll think about combining them creatively. Here's one way I can look at it:

- Notice that 53 - 2 = 51
- Now, we need a number less than 51 to subtract from it to get 44. The number 7 could fit the bill.

So I can form the equation: 53 - 2 - 7 = 44.

Therefore, the equation evaluates to 44.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 2 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that uses the numbers 89, 63, and 45, and equals 71, I will examine whether I can get close to 71 by adding or subtracting these numbers and then adjust with multiplication or division.
Multiplication and division are less likely to get me in the right neighborhood, so I'll start with a combination of addition and subtraction.
First, let's try the largest number, 89, and see if we can subtract or add other numbers in a way that brings us to around 71.
If we subtract 45 from 89, we get 44. Now, we need to get from 44 to 71. We can do this by adding 27, but there's no number in our set that equals 27. 
How about if I use 27 as 63 minus 36? Since 36 is not in the set, I can't go that way either. But 63 minus 63 is not helpful.
The next thing to consider is using all three numbers together. If I subtract 45 from 63, I get 18. Now I need to add 53 to get to 71, but there's no number in the set that equals 53.
Now, let's try another approach: combining addition and subtraction differently.
If I subtract 89 by 63, I get -24, which is not helpful since we want to reach 71.
Trying to use division:
If I divide 45 by 63, I get approximately 0.714, which doesn't help in reaching 71 when combined with 89 or 63.
After considering all these, the approach of adding and subtracting doesn't seem promising with the current combinations.
However, I might have overlooked an opportunity. Let me correct the approach: if I take 89 and 45 and use subtraction, I get 44. Now I need to reach 71 from 44, and 71 - 44 = 27. This is not directly solvable using the given numbers.
It seems I must have missed a valid solution. After re-examining combinatorial possibilities with basic operations, I find no explicit correct solution using all three numbers once in one equation to equal 71. I might have overlooked another step or combination.
The correct approach hereby hasn't been found within the constraints provided.
</think>
<answer>(89 + 45) - 63</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to generate an equation that uses the numbers 18, 11, and 59 exactly once and results in 30.
Looking at the numbers given:
- 59 seems to be the largest, so it might be helpful if we use subtraction.
- 18 and 11 do not produce 59 when they are combined in simple arithmetic operations, so I will likely use those for subtraction.
- I also need to think about how to get a result of 30.
Considering 59 - 18 = 41, this seems a bit high for our final result. So, I'll change the order to 59 - 18 = 41 and then think about what operations might reduce the number 41 to 30.
Checking 41 - 11 = 30, this equals our target and uses the numbers only once while doing so in a valid arithmetic sequence.
Thus, the equation is: 59 - 18 - 11 = 30.
</think>
<answer>59 - 18 - 11</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 58, 76, and 26 exactly once and using basic arithmetic operations, I’ll try different combinations:
- First, I’ll consider the possibility of subtraction. If I subtract 58 from 76, the result is 18. Then I can add 26 to 18 to get to 44. This gives us the equation: 76 - 58 + 26 = 44.
- I'll double check the calculations just to be sure:
  76 - 58 = 18
  18 + 26 = 44
The calculations seem correct.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 58 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 58, 76, and 26 that results in 44 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try combining these numbers in different ways. 
If I subtract 58 from 76, I get 18, and then if I add 26 to 18, I get 44. Therefore, the equation would be 76 - 58 + 26 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 58 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 1, 98, and 45. Our goal is to create an expression that equals 52.
One way to achieve this could be using subtraction and concatenation of numbers.
1. If we use 98 and 45, we can get 98 - 45 = 53.
2. The next step is to reduce this result to 52. We can subtract 1 from 53 to get 52.
3. Therefore, the expression is 98 - 45 - 1.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 45 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers available: 26, 23, and 41. We need an equation that results in 44 using these numbers and basic operations. Looking at the target number 44, 41 and 23 seem like they could be used in a subtraction operation to get to a number closer to 44. Numbers 23 and 26 can be manipulated to reach 44 through addition. 
The equation can be broken down this way:
1. We know 41 - 23 = 18
2. Then we need an additional number to reach 44, which would be 44 - 18 = 26. 
3. So the equation would actually be: 26 + (41 - 23) = 26 + 18 = 44.
So, the final equation using the numbers 26, 23, 41 to result in 44 is 26 + (41 - 23) = 44.
</think>
<answer>26 + (41 - 23)</answer>

==============
<think> Given the numbers [91, 49, 86], we need to form an equation that equals 54 using basic arithmetic operations on these numbers exactly once. We'll test different combinations using the numbers.
- 91 - 49 = 42 (Not equal to 54).
- Adding 86 to 49 - 91: (49 - 91) + 86 = -42 + 86 = 44 (Not equal to 54).
- Another combination: (91 - 86) + 49 = 5 + 49 = 54 (This equals 54 exactly).
So the equation we are looking for is (91 - 86) + 49 = 54.</think>
<answer>(91 - 86) + 49</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation with the numbers 70, 98, and 3 that equals 25, we need to consider the operations available (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Given that 25 is a relatively small number, it's likely that division or subtraction will be key operations in our solution.
Taking 98 and 70, if we subtract 98 - 70 = 28, this gives us a value we can work with. We need to reach 25, so subtracting 28 by itself doesn't work. However, using the remaining number 3, we can create the necessary adjustment.
To reduce 28 to 25, we perform 28 - 3 = 25. Therefore, the combination of numbers and operations that works is 98 - 70 - 3 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 70 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 45, 52, 10, and 63 that will give me 60. A good approach is to try to combine the smaller numbers first.
I notice that if I subtract 10 from 52, I get 42.
Next, I see that if I subtract 45 from 63, I get 18.
42 - 18 = 24 doesn't quite work, but if I add 42 - 18 - 42 + 18 = 0 does not help, so maybe there's another way to combine the numbers.
Perhaps I can try an algebraic manipulation on 45 and 63, since they are close to each other. 63 - 45 = 18, and multiplying this by 10 would give 180.
Now, if I take 45 from 180, I get 135 - 45 = 135, which isn't 60.
However, if I subtract 45 from 135 first, I get 90, and then taking 10 away from this gives 90 - 10 = 80, which is 20 from 60.
But, I need only 60. Maybe I can subtract 20 from 90 - 10.
Let's revalidate and simplify. The correct equation might directly combine the numbers in a different way.
Let's try this: 52 - 10 + (63 - 45) = 42 + 18 = 60.
This equation uses each number only once and results in 60.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 10 + (63 - 45) </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 55 using the numbers 30, 30, and 5, and performing basic arithmetic operations, I'll try to utilize the 5 in an operation that could significantly increase the value. Considering 30 + 30 = 60, which is close to 55, I'll subtract 5 to get to 55. Thus, the equation will be:
30 + 30 - 5 = 55 </think>
<answer> 30 + 30 - 5 </answer>

<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 52, 80, and 41 which equals 69. Let's first look at the options we can get with simple additions and subtractions:
1. 52 + (80 - 41) = 52 + 39 = 91 (too high)
2. (52 + 80) - 41 = 132 - 41 = 91 (still too high)
3. 52 - (80 - 41) = 52 - 39 = 13 (too low)
4. (52 - 80) + 41 = -28 + 41 = 13 (still too low)
5. (80 - 52) + 41 = 28 + 41 = 69 - This seems to work.
Therefore, the equation would be (80 - 52) + 41 = 69.
</think>
<answer>(80 - 52) + 41</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll think about multiplying and dividing to get close to 91 using the numbers 27 and 17. Notice that dividing 91 by 17 gives 5 remainder 16. So, we can try 27 * 4 - 17 to reach that 16 remainder. However, 27 * 4 = 108, and subtracting 17 from it would exceed 91. We need to consider other operations.
Next, let's examine combining 27 and 4 into a product that, when used with 17, achieves 91. 4 * 27 = 108 - 17 would be the closest we can get, but we have to consider subtraction rather than addition.
The option 4 * 27 - 17 does not work because it's too large. Let's try another sequence - 17 + 4 * 27 / 91. Dividing 91 by 17 suggests a potential fit, but 27 / 91 would be too small for subtraction. Let's re-evaluate: 4 * 27 / 17, which is 61.29, is not a whole number and does not give us whole numbers needed for 91.
By rechecking the operations, we notice we are missing the fundamental approach. A multiplication of 27 and 4 could get us close to 91 if we use it together in the right way. Hence, the correct step is 27 * 4. But it gives 108, so we need to subtract 17. But we have a 4 left, and its multiplication by 27 is 108, which when subtracted by the extra 17 would give 91.
Thus, the equation 27 * 4 - 17 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 27 * 4 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 51, 88, and 40. One way to approach this is to see if we can use subtraction or addition to get close to 99. Let's start by subtracting 40 from 51:
51 - 40 = 11
Now we have 88 and 11 to work with. We need 88 + x = 99, and solving for x gives us x = 99 - 88 = 11, which we already have in terms of our previous subtraction.
This means we can use 88 + (51 - 40) = 99, as it uses each number exactly once and satisfies the equation.
</think>
<answer>88 + (51 - 40)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 92, 36, and 10 that results in 66. One strategy is to think about manipulating or combining these numbers using operations to get closer to 66. Notice that subtracting 92 from 100 gives us 90. Therefore, if we can use 36 in such a way to get a value close to 90, we might be able to make our equation work.
Let's think of (100 - 92) = 8. So now we are trying to create 8 from the 36 and 10.
One way is to divide 36 by 10, which gives us 3.6. Now, 8 is 10 - 2, and we have 3.6, so we need to adjust our equation to fit.
The closest we can get with our current numbers is (100 - 36) - 10 + 3.6 which equals 66, but we need to fit it into our initial numbers. 
Now, rephrasing the equation using only the initial numbers, we can get:
(92 - 36) + (10 / 1.6) = 66, but 10 / 1.6 is not an integer, leading us to the next idea.
Another possible approach could be:
92 - 36 * 1.5 = 66.
However, our problem constraints require integer arithmetic and the number 1. 5 can't be achieved with only 10 and 36.
Finally, let's explore another method:
92 - 36 + (10 / 1) = 66.
Here we divide 10 by 1 to get 10, but without changing it formally as per constraints. Essentially, we're using 10 and sticking to constraints but creating the result. We do not use the division outside of it, keeping the 1 (as a concept of 10/10 or 10/1).
So the correct breakdown would involve reevaluation of closest conditions without deviation from constraints:
(92 - 36) + 10 = 66.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 36) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> We are given the numbers 78, 79, and 63. We need to form an equation with these numbers that results in 64, using basic arithmetic operations and ensuring each number is used only once.
One way to approach this is to look for a combination of operations that might yield the required result. One way to think about it is to consider whether subtraction combined with division or multiplication could give us the desired outcome.
Looking closely, we can see that:
1. 79 - 78 = 1
2. Then, 63 / 1 = 63
3. We need to get to 64, so we need to increase 63 by 1, which we already obtained from the first step.
Thus, the equation becomes: 63 + (79 - 78)
</think>
<answer> 63 + (79 - 78) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number 91 we want to achieve. Then, looking at the numbers we have [59, 34, 2], I notice that 59 is the highest and likely going to be the key number. 
My plan is to use 59 with other numbers to get close to 91. Given 59, I consider the difference: 91 - 59 = 32.
Next, I look at the numbers 34 and 2. The number 34 is very close to 32 and 2 can be used to fine-tune the equation.
To make the sum of 32 out of these numbers, I think of 34 - 2 = 32.
Therefore, if I use:
59 + (34 - 2)
The equation equals:
59 + 32, which equals 91.
</think>
<answer> 59 + (34 - 2) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 40, 82, and 27 that equals 95, we need to consider how basic arithmetic operations can be used to combine these numbers. Let's try different combinations:
1. If we multiply and divide, the results are usually not close to 95, except for trivial operations.
2. For addition and subtraction, let's consider how we can make numbers close to 95 using a combination of the given numbers.
- If we look closely at the numbers, they are quite far from 95. 82 - 27 = 55, which is close to 95, but adding any number in the bunch doesn't produce 95.
- Now let's consider the possibility of using brackets to influence the result, like (82 - 27) + 40.
(82 - 27) + 40 = 55 + 40 = 95
By using brackets and the subtraction operation, we have created a valid expression that equals 95 and uses each number provided exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 27) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by considering the numbers and the operations available. We need to make 22 using the numbers 31, 8, and 61. First, note that 61 is quite large and 31 seems more practical for reaching 22. One way might be to subtract a smaller number from 61 to get close and then add or subtract another number until we get to 22.
Considering 61 - 8 = 53, which is quite far from 22; we need to reduce it drastically.
Now, subtracting 31 from 53 gives us 22. So, we have:
61 - 8 - 31 = 22
</think>
<answer> 61 - 8 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the number 67 using the numbers 37, 32, and 2, we need to consider how to manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. One way to achieve this could be by utilizing the properties of addition and multiplication.
If we take the number 37, we can see that by adding 32 to it, we get 69, which is close to 67. Then, we would need to reduce it by 2 to get the exact figure. This suggests the equation could be: 37 + 32 - 2. Let's check:
37 + 32 = 69
69 - 2 = 67
This calculation shows that the equation 37 + 32 - 2 indeed equals 67. </think>
<answer> 37 + 32 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve 68 using the numbers 1, 21, and 90 exactly once, let's take a look at each operation:
1. Adding and subtracting is ineffective since it doesn't seem to yield a number close to 68.
2. Multiplying 90 by any other number won't work as it gives numbers too large or too close to 90.
3. Dividing 90 by any of the other numbers would give too small of a number to reach 68.
The most promising operation might be using subtraction and multiplication. 
Looking at 90 - 21 = 69. We need to reduce this to 68. We can achieve this by subtracting 1. 
So, the equation would be (90 - 21) - 1 = 68.
</think>
<answer>(90 - 21) - 1</answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 76, 92, and 84 exactly once to get 68. The numbers 76 and 92 are significantly large when directly subtracted, and adding or subtracting 84 also doesn't seem efficient enough.
One way to approach this is to consider multiplication or division as they can significantly alter the values.
92 is the largest number, so it would be useful if we could divide it, but 84 is an even number and dividing by 84 (or any other smaller number) won't yield an integer that can be adjusted to 68.
Given these considerations, the only feasible way would be to subtract or add some result of a calculation involving 84 with either 76 or 92 to reach 68.
92 - 24 would equal 68, and 92 - (76 - 8) would kinda work, but 8 is not one of the numbers we have.
84 - 16 equals 68. Now, we can see that subtracting 16 from 84 could be viable if we can get 16 using 76 and 92.
92 - 76 equals 16, and 84 - 16 equals 68.
So, the final equation becomes: 84 - (92 - 76) = 68.
</think>
<answer> 84 - (92 - 76) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation that equals 77 using the numbers 94, 91, and 80, using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations. Let's consider subtraction and addition first, since those operations can help us create a close value to 77.
Looking at the numbers, 94 and 91 are close to 185, which is remarkably close to 2 * 92.5. If we take away 80 from this, we get 105, which seems like a good step.
(94 - 80) = 14
Now we need 14 more to reach 77.
91 - 14 = 77
Summarizing, the equation looks like:
(94 - 80) + (91 - 14) = 77
However, I need to change "14" to use one of the numbers again, so let's try:
91 - (94 - 80) = 77
This changes the equation to:
91 - (94 - 80) = 77
Which simplifies to:
91 - (94 - 80) = 91 - 6 = 77
</think>
<answer> 91 - (94 - 80) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll note the numbers available: 12, 63, 22, and 10. Our goal is to reach the result of 39 using these numbers and basic arithmetic operations.
I'll start by considering the larger numbers 63 and 12. If we can use 63 in a way that it is reduced to a manageable size, we may find our solution.
Given that division is possible, as in 63 divided by 10, and the result is 6.3, we can then take away 12 (which is the second largest number) to get a reasonable integer result.
So, our equation would be: (63 / 10) - 12 = 6.3 - 12 = -5.7.
This is not quite 39, but it gives a hint. Now, since 63 / 10 doesn't give such a nice integer value, let's see if there’s a different way to arrange these numbers.
Considering the numbers 22 and 10, if we add them, we get 32. Subtract 12 from 32 and we will get 20. Still far from 39.
Now, thinking about 63, it is indeed a large number, and we might consider using its complement to a nice round number. 10 and 22 can be combined to make 32, and then we can see if we can adjust our result with 63.
Let's look at this arrangement: 63 - 22 - 10 = 31, still not 39.
Now, thinking of combining 10 and 22 in a way that their sum is used efficiently in relation to 63 and 12.
We can start with 10 + 22 = 32. Now, to make 39, we need 7 more than what we have. We can express 7 using the available digits: 12 - 10 = 2. Besides, we need 7, and we can get something close by manipulating 12 - 2 = 10's complement would be -2 (negative). So, the positive adjustment can be obtained using the operation 12 - 22.
Thus, (63 - 22) - (12 - 10) = 41 - 2 = 39.
</think>
<answer> (63 - 22) - (12 - 10) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 23, 25, 98, and 98 to form an equation that equals 49. Let's try to manipulate the given numbers using basic operations.
We see that 98 and 98 are identical, so it might be easier to use subtraction or division with them. Subtracting 23 from 98 gives us 75, but that doesn't help.
We now need to consider 25 and 23. Subtracting 23 from 25 gives us 2, which when added to 75 gives 77, and if divided by 98 we get 0.7959, which is not 49.
Let's try multiplication and division:
Multiplying 23 by 25 is 575, which is far from 49. Dividing 23 by 25 is approximately 0.92, which also doesn't get us close to 49.
Lastly, let's consider addition. Adding 25 to 23 gives us 48, which is quite close to 49. Since 49 - 48 = 1, we can use the remaining 98 to add 1. Dividing 98 by 98 gives us 1, so 48 + 1 equals 49.
Thus, the equation should be 25 + 23 + 98 / 98 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 25 + 23 + 98 / 98 </answer>

==============
<think> The target is to reach the number 47 using the numbers 45, 6, and 98 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. 
Given the numbers, we can also consider if any can be modified to help reach 47. One option is to think about fractional or decimal results. We can divide 98 by 2 to get 49, which is close to the target. Then we can use subtraction to bring it down to 47. Specifically, 47 - 6 = 41, which is a value we can get from 45 - 6 = 45 - 6 = 39. But that doesn't seem to help directly. 
However, by taking 98 - 45 = 53, and then 53 - 6 = 47, we actually directly solve the problem. </think>
<answer> (98 - 45) - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Given we are aiming to reach 47 using the numbers 45, 6, and 98, let's try a few combinations:
- Multiplying 98 by 6 gives 588, which is not close to 47.
- Subtracting 6 from 45 gives 39, not 47.
- Adding 45 and 6 gives 51, not 47.
Now, let's try division:
- Dividing 98 by 6 does not yield an integer.
- Dividing 98 by 45 would be less than 2, not near 47.
Next, let's combine operations:
- Using 98 as the dividend and 45 as the divisor: 98 / 45 = 2.177...
- This is far from 47, so we need to consider another operation.
- We see 6 could be useful here, but joining the operations:
  ((98 - 45) / 6) = 53 / 6 = 8.833...
  This is also not close to 47.
Now, let's try combining 45 and 6:
- 45 is closer to 47, and 6 could be used:
  (98 - 45) - 6 = 53 - 6 = 47
Therefore, the equation that equals 47 using the numbers 45, 6, and 98 is:
(98 - 45) - 6
</think>
<answer>(98 - 45) - 6</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the three numbers: 76, 37, and 54. We need to create an equation that equals 93 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. Let's start with addition and subtraction as these can quickly get us closer to 93.
We can observe that 76 + 54 = 130, which is too high. Subtracting 37 from 130, gives 93. Therefore, the equation could be 76 + 54 - 37 = 93.
</think>
<answer> 76 + 54 - 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 41, 40, 66, 90. Our goal is to get 75 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
Considering all operations and trying different combinations of the numbers, we need to subtract small numbers from greater ones. The number 90 seems promising as it's the largest, and 75 is quite close to 90.
Let's subtract 15 from 90:
90 - 41 = 49
This gets us closer. Now, to get to 75:
49 + 26 = 75
The remaining numbers are 40 and 66. 26 can be achieved by 40 - 14, but we don't have 14. However, 40 and 66 can be manipulated to give us 26 if we use them in a different manner.
Let's try 66 - 40 = 26, which works perfectly.
Thus, the equation is:
90 - 41 + 66 - 40 = 75
</think>
<answer> (90 - 41) + (66 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 93 using the numbers 43, 82, and 32 (each used only once) with basic arithmetic operations, I'll examine the numbers and consider possible combinations.
One approach is to see if any of the numbers when combined using basic operations can yield 93. 82 is quite close to 93, so subtracting 32 from 82 might be useful.
82 - 32 = 50
This leaves me needing to get from 50 to 93. Adding 43 to 50 will achieve this since:
50 + 43 = 93
Therefore, the equation that uses each number once and results in 93 is:
(82 - 32) + 43 = 93
</think>
<answer>(82 - 32) + 43</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers [19, 45, 7] that equals 19 with each number only used once and basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider how these numbers relate to 19.
- A direct subtraction or addition would quickly lead to obtaining 19. 
- Considering multiplication or division might not yield the number 19 straightforwardly.
- I'll focus on using subtraction or addition since they could directly give us 19.
Since 19 and 7 form the closest to 45, one possible approach could be 45 - 7 = 38, and then 38 - 19 = 19.
This approach uses all numbers once, employs subtraction effectively, and results in our target number.
</think>
<answer> (45 - 7) - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers [37, 64, 43] that equals 16, I will focus on the relationships between the numbers. One key observation is that 37 and 43 are quite close, and if I can get them to sum to something, I might be able to manipulate that result to yield 16. The sum of 37 and 43 is 80. Now, I have 64, and if I take 80 and subtract 64, I get 16. So the equation becomes 80 - 64 = 16. However, I need to use all three numbers only once. I can use the first two numbers, 37 and 43, to achieve 80. Thus, the equation becomes (37 + 43) - 64. 
</think>
<answer> (37 + 43) - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> To reach the number 49 using the numbers 73, 2, and 26 exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations, let's consider the operations in a strategic way.
First, 73 is quite far from 49, so let's consider subtracting a smaller number. Subtracting 26 from 73 will give us:
\[ 73 - 26 = 47 \]
Now, we need to adjust our result to be 49. The differences between 49 and 47 are:
\[ 49 - 47 = 2 \]
This suggests we could use our second number 2, but we can't use it as it's already been used as an operand. We could employ the inverse of subtraction, which is addition, but for that, we would need another 2, which isn't available directly in the mix.
The simplest way is to directly add the missing 2 to our current result:
\[ 47 + 2 = 49 \]
Therefore, we can say the equation as:
\[ 73 - 26 + 2 = 49 \]
</think>
<answer> 73 - 26 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to find a way to use the numbers 18, 22, and 59 to make 19. We can do this by trying different combinations of the arithmetic operations provided.
Looking at the numbers, 59 seems like a strong candidate for subtraction or division to get closer to a reasonable value for further operations. Let's subtract the smallest number from 59. 
\[ 59 - 18 = 41 \]
This is a big number. Next, we could use 22. By subtracting 22 from 41, we get:
\[ 41 - 22 = 19 \]
This gives us the result we are looking for. The numbers 18 and 22 are used once, and we only used subtraction. Thus the equation is:
\[ 59 - 18 - 22 = 19 \]
</think>
<answer> 59 - 18 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 34 using the numbers 78, 81, and 31 exactly once, we should consider a few combinations of the arithmetic operations.
Let's start with the possibilities:
- Using subtraction and addition: 81 - 78 + 31
- Checking the values: 81 - 78 = 3, then 3 + 31 = 34. Seems to match our target.
Since 81 - 78 + 31 results in 34, we have found a valid equation.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 78 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 73, 35, and 35 exactly once, we should look for patterns or possible operations that can add up to 73.
We can employ addition or multiplication to reach the number. 
Given that we have two 35s, the first thought is that we might be able to manipulate these numbers to sum up to a relevant number before adding 73.
Let's see if taking the product of the 35s and then adding 73 can work:
35 * 35 = 1225
If we then add 73 to 1225:
1225 + 73 = 1298
This doesn't equal 73, so we should explore other operations.
Next, let's try combining these steps differently:
Considering 35 * 35 = 1225, let's see what happens if we take the difference between 1225 and 73:
1225 - 73 = 1152
This doesn't give us a good number either.
Nearly out of options, let's reconsider the mechanics. 
If we take the total 35 + 35 = 70 and add it to 73:
70 + 73 = 143
This doesn't fit our criteria as it's greater. 
Taking another approach, let's try subtracting:
35 - 35 = 0
This is clearly zero and is not the goal.
Finally, considering we must use all numbers and operations, let's hold out for the solution that involves both numbers 35 and 73 in a different manner. 
It seems the simplest formation is (35 * 2) + 73:
(35 * 2) + 73 = 70 + 73 = 143, which does not fit.
Let's simplify it more. We could subtract 35+35 and then use the difference from 73:
73 - (35 + 35) = 73 - 70 = 3, which doesn't work.
Then recalling the multiplication:
(73 - 35) * 35 = (38 * 35) which evaluates to 1330, much larger.
Revisiting it:
Since the subtraction led us far, simplification needs precise adjustment:
(35 + 35) - 35 = 35 + 35 - 35 = 35
(35 - 35) * 2 = 0
(73 - 35) * 2 = 42 * 2 = 84
Ultimately, the best form still, revisiting:
(35 + 35) - 73 + 35 = 70 - 73 + 35 = 35 - 73 + 35 = 0 + 35 = 35
Unlocking:
(35 + 35) - (73 - 35) = 70 - 38 = 32, not fitting either.
Finally, last option:
(73 - 35) - 35 = 38 - 35 = 3 doesn't work.
Diving deeper:
The only way is:
(73 - 35) + 35 = 38 + 35 = 73, works with two uses.
</think>
<answer> (73 - 35) + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 43, 53, and 67 in a way that results in 29. I'll start by considering what kind of arithmetic operation(s) could work: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Let's first check if multiplication or division could yield the answer; they generally wouldn't, as the combination of the numbers (43, 53, 67) would make it hard to get a result close to 29.
Considering the remaining option, addition and subtraction could be useful. If we try combining them, let's see if we can use one of the numbers to balance the result.
One way this might work is to think about if there's a pattern in these numbers that could add up to something close to 29. Looking at 43 and 53, we can see they sum to 96, which is far from 29. But we can try subtracting a number.
If we subtract 67 from the sum of 43 and 53, the equation looks like this: 43 + 53 - 67.
Let's calculate it.
43 + 53 = 96
96 - 67 = 29
This equation equals 29 using the numbers provided, with each number used only once.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 53 - 67 </answer>

<think> To solve this, we need to combine the given numbers using basic arithmetic operations to make the result equal to 71. The numbers are 35, 9, 59, and 86. 

First, I'll consider the operation that might yield the nearest result close to 71. One intuitive step could be combining 35 and 59 to get closer to 71.
\[ 59 - 35 = 24 \]
This gives us 24 which is too far from 71.

Next, I'll try to involve another number. Let's add 9 to 24:
\[ 24 + 9 = 33 \]
This gives us 33, which is still not 71. 

Adding 86 to 33:
\[ 33 + 86 = 119 \]
This is too high, so I'll try the subtraction approach. 

Now I'll try subtracting 86 from 59 to see where that gets me:
\[ 59 - 86 = -27 \]
This is too low. 

Combining 35 and 9:
\[ 35 + 9 = 44 \]
Now, let's add this to 59:
\[ 44 + 59 = 103 \]
This is too high, so I consider another possibility. Adding 9 to -27 gives:
\[ -27 + 9 = -18 \]
Adding this to 59:
\[ -18 + 59 = 41 \]
This is closer, but still too low. 

Lastly, I will try to subtract 9 from 59, and then add 35:
\[ 59 - 9 = 50 \]
\[ 50 + 35 = 85 \]
This is still not correct. 

Then, I'll try another set: subtract 35 from 59 and then add 9:
\[ 59 - 35 = 24 \]
\[ 24 + 9 = 33 \]
Clearly, none of my attempts have worked so far. 

After rechecking, I find:
\[ 35 + (86 - 59) = 35 + 27 = 62 \]
This is still not 71. 

Finally, I thought about rearranging:
\[ 86 - 59 + 35 + 9 = 27 + 35 + 9 = 71 \]

This combination works, as I got:
\[ (86 - 59) + (35 + 9) = 27 + 44 = 71 \]

Therefore, the equation is:
\[ 86 - 59 + 35 + 9 = 71 \]
</think>
<answer> 86 - 59 + 35 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> Given the numbers 12, 84, and 19, we need to form an equation that equals 53. We can start by examining what operations might be useful. Multiplication and division can help us get larger or smaller numbers.
- Multiplying 12 by 84 would give a very large number (1008), which is far from 53.
- Dividing 84 by 12 gives 7, which isn't 53 either.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers may be simpler. Let's start trying simpler combinations.
Since 84 is quite large, we should consider how we can break it down or use a combination with 12 to approach our target of 53.
Considering the equation (84 - 19) / 12 might work, we can calculate:
84 - 19 = 65
65 / 12 = 5.4166...
This is close, but not exactly 53. Let's try another approach by possibly using 19 as part of the equation.
(84 + 12) / 19 = 96 / 19 which is larger than 53.
Now, let's consider:
(84 / 12) - 19 = 7 - 19 = -12
This is still not 53.
Let's re-examine:
19 + (84 / 12) = 19 + 7 = 26
This is also incorrect.
Finally, consider:
84 - (19 + 12) = 84 - 31 = 53
This gives us 53 exactly.
Thus, the correct equation is 84 - (19 + 12) = 53. </think>
<answer> 84 - (19 + 12) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 40, 62, and 68 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to make 90. One way to approach this is to consider the differences between these numbers, as well as possible sums or other combinations.
First, let's look at the difference between 68 and 40 which is 28. Now, if we add 62 to this difference, we should get closer to 90:
68 - 40 = 28
62 + 28 = 90
This shows that the equation is:
62 + (68 - 40) = 90
</think>
<answer> 62 + (68 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the numbers 37, 97, and 56. The target is to create an expression that results in 78.
How about I add 56 and 22 (37 + 97 - 56 = 78). However, to get 22 from 37 and 56, I must use subtraction. If I subtract 56 from 97, I get 41.
So, the expression becomes: 97 - 56 + 37. 
Let's verify:
97 - 56 = 41
41 + 37 = 78
So, the final equation is 97 - 56 + 37.
</think>
<answer>97 - 56 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the straightforward possibilities with the numbers 37, 97, and 56. The number 56 seems like it could be split or subtracted to reach 78, but 97 is quite large. 
Looking at 97 and 56, subtracting 56 from 97 gives 41. Adding 37 to 41 results in 78.
So the equation would be 97 - 56 + 37 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 56 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider how we can combine these numbers to get 69. We have 80, 15, and 26. Let's try starting with 80 and see how we can get to 69 using the other numbers.
We see that 80 - 15 = 65 is close to 69. So, we need an extra 4 to reach 69. Since 26 - 22 = 4 doesn't work with our known numbers, let's try combining these in a different way.
Let's try 80 - 22 = 58 and then add 15 to it to get 73. We're still short of 4. We have one 15 left, so we can try to make 4 from this 15 and 22.
Since 22 - 15 = 7, we need another 12 to reach 4 (because 7 - 12 = -5 and -5 + 15 = 10 and then subtracting 6 more to get to 4 leaves us with 15 - 6 = 9 which is too much), but we can just use 15 - 11 = 4. So far, this doesn't work directly.
Instead, let's backtrack and try another approach: 80 - 26 = 54, then add 15 to get 69. This works perfectly. So we have:
80 - 26 + 15 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 26 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 56, 44, and 56 to create an equation that equals 68. One way to approach this is to consider how the 56s can be manipulated first since they are identical.
The operations I can use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's start with examining how the two 56s can be combined with the 44 to get 68.
If I use the 44 and one 56 for subtraction, I have 44 - 56 = -12. 
From here, adding the other 56 would only add, and subtraction the 56 would decrease to -12 - 56 = -68.
Multiplying 44 by 56 (which would be 2464) or multiplying 56 by 56 (2704) would not get close to 68 either.
However, taking half of 56 (which is 28) and combining it with 44 gives us 28 + 44 = 72.
72 is too large, and subtracting would not fit exactly to 68. Dividing 56 by 56 (which is 1) and adding 44 does not reach 68.
Due to an oversight, consider the sum of 44 and 56, then dividing by 56.
(44 + 56) / 56 = 100 / 56 which is approximately 1. 7857, far from 68.
We've made some mistakes here.  When looking at the problem with a fresh point of view,  we see that we might overcomplicate by not considering the direct subtraction from larger to smaller number.
56 - 44 = 12.
If we then add the remaining 56, we get 12 + 56 = 68.
Thus, the equation is (56 - 44) + 56 = 68.
</think>
<answer>(56 - 44) + 56</answer>

==============
<think> To get 37 using the numbers 1, 67, and 31, one way to approach this is to think of the difference between 67 and 31, and then adjust that by adding or subtracting another number.
67 - 31 = 36
Now, we have 36 and we need to get to 37. The difference is 1, so we can add 1 to 36 to get 37.
So, the equation is:
36 + 1 = 37
We can check if we can use the number 1 in this equation. Since 1 is already part of the given numbers, it doesn't need to be used separately.
Therefore, the equation is directly 36 + 1 = 37.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 31) + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use 32 and 92 wisely to get close to 62, then combine it with the remaining number 2.
Since 32 - 29 = 3 (close to 92 - 92 = 0), using 32 - 92 + 2 might work.
We can start with 92 - 32 = 60 and then adjust to 60 + 2 = 62.
Hence, the equation is 92 - 32 + 2 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 32 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 80, 49, and 33. To get to 74, we need to manipulate these numbers with arithmetic operations. 
We can start by subtracting 33 from 76, which gives us 43. It seems this is not getting us closer to 74.
Now, let's subtract 49 from 80, which gives us 31. So at this stage, we have the numbers 43, 31, and 33 to work with.
To get the target number 74, we need to find a way to combine these numbers with the operations available. Adding 31 to 43 gives us 74.
Therefore, the equation we can form is: 
(80 - 49) + (76 - 33) = 31 + 43 = 74.
</think>
<answer>(80 - 49) + (76 - 33)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers to reach 76 using the given numbers [16, 46, 46]. Adding the two 46s gives 92, which is too high.
Next, subtracting 16 from 92 still results in 76, which is exactly what we need.
Therefore, the equation will be: 92 - 16 = 76.
However, I only have 46 twice in the set, so I'll have to use them in a way that adds to 92. Adding 46 to 46 equals 92.
So the equation is: 46 + 46 - 16 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 46 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> To reach the result of 66 using the numbers 67, 13, 52, and 38 exactly once, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations. 
First, let's look at the possibilities:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers won't yield 66 without exceeding the target.
- Multiplying 67 by 13 gives a large product (871) that's far from 66.
- Attempting to use division might be advantageous, but as division tends to result in fractions, we must multiply or add with the quotient to reach our target.
Given this, let's try to use multiplication and subtraction:
- 67 - 13 - 52 = 1
- 1 * 38 = 38
- 66 - 38 = 28
- 67 - 13 - 52 + 38 = 40
None of these options works precisely. Let's try a different approach by manipulating the numbers through addition and subtraction.
- 52 + 13 = 65
- 65 - 38 = 27
- 67 - 27 = 40
- 67 - 13 - 52 + 38 = 40
This still doesn't give us our target. 
Finally, let's try the subtraction option differently:
- 67 - 52 = 15
- 15 + 13 = 28
- 28 + 38 = 66
This seems promising, but we haven't used all the numbers. Let's try another permutation:
- (67 - 52) + (13 + 38) = 15 + 51 = 66
Now, I've considered using each number only once and combining them correctly through addition and subtraction.
</think>
<answer>(67 - 52) + (13 + 38)</answer>

==============
<think> We need to combine the numbers 46, 12, and 39 using the basic arithmetic operations to get 73. The number 46 seems to be our starting point since it's closest to 73.
Let's try to utilize 39 and 12. Subtracting 12 from 46 gives us 34, which is not exactly 73. Adding 39 to 34 results in 73, which is the target number. Therefore, the equation becomes 46 - 12 + 39 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 46 - 12 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the target number 83 using the numbers 95, 45, and 33 exactly once, let's start by considering possible combinations with the given operations. One effective approach could be to utilize subtraction and division. If I subtract 33 from 95, I get 62. Then to reach 83, adding 41 to this result would be necessary. However, 41 cannot be produced by only using 45 and the remaining 33 in two steps.
Instead, if I divide 33 by 3, I get 11. Now if I subtract this result from 45, I get 34, which is closer to 83.
Then, adding the 62 from before to this 34 will give a total of 96, which is too high. We need to further adjust our approach.
Instead of subtracting 33 from 95, let's consider subtracting 45 from 95. This gives 50. Adding 33 to 50 would give 83, and this fulfills our requirement.
Thus, the equation would be: (95 - 45) + 33 = 83.
</think>
<answer>(95 - 45) + 33</answer>

==============
<think> I'll first consider a strategy that attempts to reach 89 directly from the numbers 13, 10, 66. One potential way is to utilize multiplication and addition.
Given the numbers 13, 10, and 66, I observe that 66 * 10 = 660, which is way too high. Multiplying by 13 gives 818 which is also too high.
Considering division in the equation, dividing 66 by 10 gives 6.6, which isn't an integer and will complicate the subsequent steps.
Trying to use 13 with division, 13 divided by 66 gives an insignificant value. 
Multiplying 13 by 10 gives 130, which is close but still needs adjustment.
The simplest approach could be to add the remaining numbers after calculation, like 66 + 10 + 13 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 10 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> To solve this, I need to use each of the numbers [13, 10, 66] exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations. The target result here is 89. If I look at the number 66, it's rather large, so subtracting it from 89 may help simplify the remaining part. However, 89 - 66 = 23, which still requires another number so this isn't immediately useful. 
Next, if I add 13 to 66, I get 79, which brings me closer to 89. The difference from 79 to 89 is 10, and the only remaining number we have is 10. If I use 10 + 13, I get 23, which aligns perfectly with what we need to make 89. Thus, 79 + 10 = 89.
So the equation is 79 + 10, which is 66 + 13 + 10. </think>
<answer> 66 + 13 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 12, 29, and 31, one approach would be to look for a combination where one of these can be used as a smaller value, and the combination of the other two achieves the difference.
Given 48, we can calculate that:
29 + 31 = 60
Since we need 48, we need to reduce 60 to 48.
If we subtract 12 from 48, we get:
60 - 12 = 48
So, we have our equation: 29 + 31 - 12 = 48.
</think>
<answer> (29 + 31) - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 45, and 17 that result in 48. One way to approach this is to explore different combinations of the numbers and arithmetic operations.
One useful strategy is multiplication and addition. 
Considering the numbers 45 and 17, their sum is 62. 
If we can reach 62 with the other number and then subtract or add more to get 48, that would be a possible solution.
45 + 17 = 62, and 62 - 14 = 48.
</think>
<answer> (45 + 17) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 53, 99, 74, and 62. We need to use basic arithmetic operations to form an equation that equals 16. The number 16 is close to 74, so using 74 as one of the main numbers seems sensible.
Let's try to subtract 53 and 62 from 74. This will give us:
74 - 53 - 62 = -43
This does not work as it gives us an incorrect result.
Let's think about another possibility: if we take 99 and subtract 74 and 62, we get:
99 - 74 - 62 = -47
This is also incorrect.
However, if we rearrange the operations and consider multiplication or division along with subtraction, we can get closer.
Given that 99 is quite large, we might not get 16 directly, but if we use 99 divided by 62:
(99 / 62) ≈ 1. 60
This still doesn't lead to 16. It would be better to try to use all numbers involved and see if we can form 16 with the remaining numbers. A combination that might work is:
99 - 74 + 62 - 53
Calculating this gives:
99 - 74 = 25
25 + 62 = 87
87 - 53 = 34
This is still not 16. Let's relate this to our targets of using all numbers exactly once and getting 16. Given that our derived attempts did not work out, another way to approach it would be to see if we can use each number differing operations:
99 - 74 = 25
25 - 62 = -37
Here we are still not reaching 16. Lastly, let's consider 99 - 74 - 62 + 53:
99 - 74 = 25
25 - 62 = -37
-37 + 53 = 16
This gives us the final result of 16 by utilizing 99, 74, 62, and 53 with the arithmetic operations given.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 74 - 62 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 93, 19, 5, and 94 to create an equation that equals 15. Let's consider possible combinations of operations.
One approach is to use subtraction and division to get a closer value to 15. 
Starting with the numbers, 94 - 93 = 1. To get closer to 15, I can add 14 to 1, and I see that 19 - 5 = 14.
Therefore, the equation becomes: 94 - 93 + 19 - 5 = 15.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 93 + 19 - 5) </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 75, 50, and 47 that equals 25. One efficient approach is to look at whether any of the numbers, or their combination, can be manipulated to reach this result.
Given the numbers, notice that 50 - 47 = 3.
Now, we need an operation that will reduce 3 to 25 / 10 = 25.
50 - 47 = 3, and we need to make it 25 / 10. Thus, we can use the other number (75) to divide our result.
75 / 3 = 25.
So, combining these, the equation will be 75 / (50 - 47) = 25.
</think>
<answer> 75 / (50 - 47) </answer>

==============
<think> To get a result of 90, given the numbers 32, 25, 84, and 1, we need to use basic arithmetic operations. 
- Start by checking if any combination of those numbers can make 90.
- Given that 84 + 25 = 109 (which is close but too high) and 84 + 1 = 85 (also too high), we need to include 32 in addition to 1 or a combination with 25.
- The number 25 can be manipulated to reach closer to 90. Noticing that 25 - 1 = 24 is close to what we need to add.
- Therefore, 84 + (32 - 1) = 84 + 31 = 115 (which is too high).
- Now, let's try 84 + (32 - 25 - 1) = 84 + (32 - 26) = 84 + 6 = 90.
- So, we get our solution by adding 6 to 84 using a combination of 32 - 25 - 1.
</think>
<answer> 84 + (32 - 25 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using 83, 71, and 87 that equals 75, I need to consider how these numbers can be combined with basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by considering if any of the numbers can be subtracted from another.
First, 87 - 83 = 4. This is close but still not the target. Next, let's try combining this with 71, which seems like a more strategic option. However, subtracting 71 from this result (4 - 71) would give -67, which is not helpful.
Now, let's consider adding or subtracting 71, 4 (as 87 - 83 = 4). Adding 71 + 4 = 75. This is exactly what we want!
Thus, the equation can be constructed as follows:
71 + (87 - 83) = 75.
</think>
<answer> 71 + (87 - 83) </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 76 using the numbers 91, 81, and 96 with the given operations, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, I'll consider the numbers and try to see if I can find a pattern or combination that works. I notice that 96 is the closest to 76, so it might be a starting point.
Let's try subtracting 96 from 91:
91 - 96 = -5
Now we are left with -5 and 81. It doesn't look promising.
Next, let's try adding 81 to 96:
96 + 81 = 177
That is too high.
Considering the subtraction farther, let's try using 81 with the numbers; 96 - 81 gives:
96 - 81 = 15
Now, we have to use 91 and 15 in a way that equals 76. This suggests division:
91 / 15 = 6.0666...
This doesn't yield the number 76.
In summary, these operations are not working so far. 
Instead, consider another approach by looking at 81 and 96:
(96 - 81) = 15
And then subtract this from 91:
91 - 15 = 76
This arrangement appears valid.
</think>
<answer> 91 - (96 - 81) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 7, and 52 that equals 44. Let's consider all basic arithmetic operations - addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
- Multiplication seems unlikely as it would likely increase our result, making it difficult to reach 44 from these numbers. 
- Division might be helpful, but I need to ensure the result doesn't exceed 52 or be too small.
- Considering these, addition and subtraction might offer a good balance.
- Given 52 is the largest number, subtracting or using it as part of another operation could help.
- I'm going to try subtracting 15 from 52 first because it leaves us with 37, which is close to 44, and 37 - 7 = 30 which is far from our target.
- Now to get to 44 from 37, adding 7 seems like a good way.
So the equation I'm forming is (52 - 15) + 7 = 44.
</think>
<answer>(52 - 15) + 7</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 69, 20, and 26 to create an equation that equals 63. 
First, 69 seems like an outlier number, so I think breaking it down might help. 
Let's see if we can get closer to 63 with the combination of 20 and 26. 
20 + 26 = 46, which is close to 63 but too low.
Now, let's try using subtraction. If we subtract 46 from 69:
69 - 46 = 23
This makes 23, but we need 47 to reach 63 (69 - 23 = 46, 46 + 20 = 66, 66 + 7 = 63).
Since we can't use 7, let's consider the sum of 20 and 26 again and think about how we can adjust the equation.
If we use multiplication, 26 * 2 = 52, and then adding 20: 
52 + 20 = 72, which is too high.
Trying a different combination, we can see if we can manipulate the original numbers:
0.5 * 26 = 13 and 69 - 13 = 56, then 56 / 20 = 2.8, which is also not right.
Considering the possible addition of 20 to the result of 69 - 26:
69 - 26 = 43 and then 43 + 20 = 63.
So, the final equation should be 69 - 26 + 20 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 26 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 95 using the numbers 65, 98, and 68 exactly once and using basic arithmetic operations, I'll start by checking how close I can get to 95 without exceeding it.
Adding 98 to 65 gives 163, which is too large.
Subtracting 65 from 98 gives 33, which is too small.
Multiplying these numbers gives 65 * 98 = 6370, which is clearly too much.
Dividing these numbers, even in any combination, doesn't seem to produce a meaningful result close to 95.
The numbers 68 and 98 have a significant difference, and 65 is closer but still not close enough to 95 when combined alone.
If I use subtraction between 98 and 65, I get 33, which is too small. Then, I need to add something to get close to 95. The remaining number is 68, which could be useful.
Using 33 + 68, we get 101, which is not 95. The difference is 6. To reach 95, I need to subtract 6 from 101.
But I can also adjust by adding 68 to 33, giving 101, and then subtract 6. This 6 could be derived from subtracting 65 from 98, but I'd need another way to reach a result.
Considering simpler combinations: 98 - 68 is 30, and adding 65 gives:
98 - 68 + 65 = 30 + 65 = 95
So, the operation that works is 98 - 68 + 65, and we use the numbers exactly once and as given. </think>
<answer> 98 - 68 + 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using 65, 98, and 68 that results in 95. Let's start by acknowledging that using all numbers directly would typically not yield the target number 95. Considering one of the numbers would need to be manipulated through an operation to get closer to 95, let's test a few ideas.
  
Since 98 is the largest number, using 98 as it is or manipulating it to move closer to 95 seems obviously unhelpful. Using the 65 number alone, it's not enough to get to 95. 
Looking at the remaining numbers 68, the most logical next step is to consider subtraction. We can subtract a smaller number from 68 to get closer to 95, e.g., 68 - 63 or 68 - 7. However, 63 isn't an available option and 68 - 7 = 61, which is still some distance from 95.
Now we consider subtraction from 98. 98 - 68 = 30, which doesn't help directly, but close in some sense suggests looking at how we can combine 30 with 65 and 68.
Combining 65 and 30, we'd get 95. So the equation becomes 65 + 30. But we need to make the 30 using the numbers 68 and 98.
98 - 68 = 30.
Thus, 65 + 98 - 68 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 98 - 68 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look at the numbers provided: 16, 6, 34, and 79. 
To reach 91, we need to play around with the operations that might give us that result.
Considering simple operations, let's see if there's a pair of numbers we can easily manipulate.
If I subtract 6 from 34, I get 28. Now I have the numbers 16, 28, and 79.
Next, adding 16 to 28 gives 44. Now I'm left with 44 and 79.
Finally, 79 - 44 = 35. Adding this 35 to the original 16 I have gives:
16 + 35 = 51.
Clearly, we need 91, which is 51 + 40, and 40 is the difference between 79 and 39. Since it's not possible to get 39 with the given numbers, we'll try another combination.
Let's try: 
79 - 34 = 45
45 + 16 = 61
Now, we need to get from 61 to 91. Subtracting 61 from 91 results in 30. We need to see if we can form 30.
Using 16 in any operation won't get us to 30, so let's try another path.
Instead, looking at 34 - 16 = 18. We could try:
79 - 61 = 18
18 + 34 = 52
52 + 16 = 68
And to reach 91, we just need to:
68 + 23: But we can directly write 34 - 16 = 18.
So from all these possibilities, it seems 34 - 16 = 18,
then 18 + 34 = 52 and 52 + 16 = 68 and finally 68 + 23.
Let's closely focus on the straightforward solution.
If I use the numbers provided 16, 6, 34, and 79 correctly:
34 - 16 = 18
18 + 79 = 97 but we want 91, so subtract 6:
(34 - 16) + (79 - 6) = 91.
</think>
<answer>(34 - 16) + (79 - 6)</answer>

==============
<think> We are given three digits: 56, 11, and 31. We need to create an equation using these digits once each and the basic arithmetic operations to equal 76. 
One way to solve this is to consider combining 56 with 11 in a way that leads us closer to 76. If we subtract 11 from 56, we get 45. Now, we need the difference between 45 and 76 to be 31. This means 76 - 45 = 31, and we have used all numbers.
Therefore, the equation becomes 56 - 11 + 31 = 76. </think>
<answer> 56 - 11 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to reach the result of 41 using the numbers 12, 11, and 40 exactly once. 
A good starting point is to see if any combination of these numbers can give us 41 directly without needing other operations. 
Multiplying 11 by 4 is 44, which brings us close to 41. 
If we subtract 3 (which is 4 - 1), we are left with 1, which we can obtain from 12 - 11.
So, we can form an equation as follows: (12 - 11) * 11 + 40 - 11 = 41
However, the parentheses are not needed as per the problem specifications. Also, my initial thought of +40 - 11 incorrectly considered unnecessary addition and subtraction steps. 
The simplest equation fulfilling the criteria is when we have: (40 - 11 + 12) = 41.
</think>
<answer>(40 - 11 + 12)</answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 12, 9, and 80 that equals 83. We need to use each number exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's see how we can use the numbers to approach the target:
- We can start by looking at the difference between 80 and 9 which gives us 71.
- Then we need to add 12 to reach 83.
So, 80 - 9 + 12 would give us the calculation.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 9 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 19, 10, and 67. Let's start by checking if there's a way to combine the numbers to get close to 38.
The number 67 looks like too big to subtract or use directly to reach the target of 38. So, let's consider other combinations.
Now if we subtract 19 from 67, we get 48, which is 10 more than our target.
This gives us: 67 - 19 = 48
Next, to reduce from 48 to 38, we can subtract 10. This is one of the given numbers.
So the equation becomes: 67 - 19 - 10 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 19) - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to make 72 using the numbers 65, 8, and 56. 
Looking at the numbers, it seems dividing 56 by 8 makes 7. It's not quite 72, but it's close. 
Then, if I add 65 and 7, it will give me 72. So the equation would be:
65 + (56 / 8) = 72
To check this, I'll break it down into steps:
1) Calculate 56 / 8, which equals 7
2) Then, add that result to 65, 65 + 7 = 72
</think>
<answer> 65 + (56 / 8) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 8, 75, 48 exactly once to get to 69. Let's start by evaluating the numbers. 75 and 48 are quite large, making them difficult to use as operands or targets for subtraction or division. 8, on the other hand, could be a useful number to get closer to 69 or could be a target itself.
Trying 75 - 48 = 27, which is close but not quite right.
How about we try 75 - (48 / 8) = 75 - 6 = 69.
This seems to work as 75 - 6 equals 69 exactly, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (48 / 8) </answer>

==============
<think> To get an equation summing up to 44 using the numbers 65, 94, and 73 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I'll start by calculating the sum of the available numbers: 
65 + 94 + 73 = 232
This total is much larger than 44 and using subtraction or division alone isn't going to get us to 44 from here. So, I'll try to find a way to subtract and divide these numbers.
- If I subtract 73 from 65, I'll get 94 - 73 = 21.
- Then, if I subtract this result (21) from 94, I'll have 94 - 21 = 73.
- Finally, if I divide 73 by 21 (result of the previous step), I'll get 73 / 21 approximately equal to 3.476.
It's not an exact match, but this is a closer result. However, simple division and subtraction in this manner don't yield an exact 44. I'll try another possibility, focusing on 65 and 94.
- If I subtract 21 from 65, I'll get 65 - 21 = 44.
- This result, 44, exactly matches our target.
So, the valid equation that results in 44 using the numbers 65, 94, and 73 without rearranging them would be as follows:
(65 - (94 - 73)) = 44
</think>
<answer>(65 - (94 - 73))</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that uses the numbers 70, 95, and 75 to equal 90, I'll first consider the differences and sums that can be formed with these numbers.
- 95 - 75 = 20
- 95 - 70 = 25
- 70 - 75 = -5
- 95 + 70 = 165
- 95 + 75 = 170
- 70 + 75 = 145

Of these, the only combination that alone or through any arithmetic operation results in 90 is when we perform a subtraction and addition: 95 - 75 + 70 = 90.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 75) + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I'll consider adding or subtracting the numbers to get close to 71. Given the numbers 14, 93, and 8, 93 is notably close to 71, so I'll use it as it is. Then, 14 and 8 need to be manipulated to make up the remainder (71 - 93 = -22). 
Multiplying 14 by 8 gives 112, which is too large, so I'll consider division. Dividing 112 by 8 gives 14, so if I subtract this from 93 (93 - 14), I'll end up with 79. This is still not 71.
Now I recall that I can divide numbers by 14 or use subtraction to meet the result. We can consider the reverse operation of multiplication by 14, and the reverse of the subtraction operation (addition). After 14 * 8 = 112, subtracting would be equivalent to dividing by 14.
112 / 14 = 8, so to get 71, I'll subtract 8 from 93 and then subtract 14 from that result, which is 93 - 8 - 14 = 71.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 8) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 74 using the numbers 58, 63, and 69 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I'll start with combinations of these numbers.
If I subtract 58 from 69, I get 11. Now I have 63 and 11 left to use.
Adding 63 to 11 gives 74, which is exactly what we need.
So the equation becomes: 69 - 58 + 63 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 58 + 63 </answer>

==============
<think> To get an equation equaling 74 using the numbers 58, 63, and 69, we need to consider each number in relation to the others. One effective approach is to use subtraction and addition to create the desired number.
We can start by subtracting 58 from 63 which gives us 5. Then we add 69 to this result. This gives us: 63 - 58 + 69. Now we just need to do the calculation: 63 - 58 equals 5 and then adding 69 to 5 gives us 74.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 58 + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers given: 27, 71, and 67. I need to create an equation that equals 31 using these numbers only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Looking at the numbers, I notice that 67 - 71 equals -4, which is not helpful for reaching 31. I'll try 71 - 27, which equals 44, also not helpful. Instead, I should consider the order of subtraction.
If I do 71 - 27, I get 44. Then I can see that 44 - 13 would give me 31. Now, I need to see if 67 - 27 can give me 13. Indeed, it does: (67 - 27) = 40 / 2 = 20 / 1 = 13.
So, I can construct the equation as follows: 71 - (67 - 27) = 31.
</think>
<answer> 71 - (67 - 27) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that results in 93 using the numbers 18, 64, and 47, I need to consider the arithmetic operations in a strategic way.
If I look at the numbers, 64 is the largest, which suggests it might be a good candidate to subtract from or divide and combine with others to reach the target.
64 - 47 = 17, which is closer to 93, but not quite there.
So, I could consider the operation 64 * 1. 85, but since we can only use whole numbers and cannot use any number more than once, we must look for another combination.
Taking 47 - 18 = 29, now we need 64 + 29 to equal 93.
However, 64 + 29 = 93.
Thus, we get the following equation:
64 + (47 - 18) = 93.
</think>
<answer> 64 + (47 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 39 using the numbers 90, 89, 52, and 88 exactly once. One way to approach this is to try to use the larger numbers for the operations to get closer to 39 without exceeding it.
First, I'll subtract 88 from 90 to get 2. Now I have 2, 89, and 52 left.
Next, 89 - 52 = 37. Now I have 2 and 37.
To get to 39, I need to add 2. The number 2 is already there, so I just need to figure out a way to make 37 using 89 and 52.
I'll subtract 52 from 89 which gives me 37. Now I have 2 and 37, which indeed add up to 39.
So the equation is: (89 - 52) + (90 - 88) = 39.
</think>
<answer>(89 - 52) + (90 - 88)</answer>

==============
<think> To form an equation from the numbers 90, 89, 52, and 88 that equals 39 using basic arithmetic operations and with each number used only once, we need to consider combinations of the numbers and operations.
Let's examine the numbers carefully. Notice that 90 - 52 = 38 is close to 39. If we can use 89 or 88 in some way to adjust slightly from 38 to 39, it could work.
Considering 89 - 52 = 37 is still far off but if we add or manipulate the digits, it seems more plausible to try subtractions. Let's consider 89 - 52 - 1 could be possible given 1 might be a combination of digits. But here 52 - 1 is not a typical operation. Instead, let's think of the possibility of 89 - 52 + 1. 
However, 52 + 1 = 53 is too high; let's try another manipulation. Instead, we can attempt a combination looking at the middle number 88, as 88 - 52 = 36, which is still significantly less than 39. Now, adding 12 (89 - 77) could be another approach, but as 89 - 52 = 37, we might see if adding or subtracting differently can accomplish it.
Then thinking through, if we take 89 - 52 and use the number 88, we get 89 - 52 - 88 = -1 is not correct. It seems combining 89 = 88+1 and 52 = 49 would be needed. Now, 89 - 52 + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 is close. But we can try the remaining number 90, subtracting or adding to adjust, but it further complicates the other number combinations. 
Considering individual operations and their usage, rearrangement of 89 - (52 + 88) or 89 - (52 + 90 - 88) checks out straightforwardly: 89 - 52 - 88 doesn't work. Let's consolidate the numbers and operations: 89 - 52 - 88 is incorrect, but considering 89 - (52 + 88 - 90) works better giving us a more accurate equation.
</think>
<answer> 89 - (52 + 88 - 90) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers given: 10, 53, and 91. 
To get 48, the target number, we should focus on how to combine these numbers effectively. 
One approach is to consider 53 as a close approximation of 50 (53 - 3 = 50). 
Using subtraction, 91 - 53 = 38, which is close to 48.
Then, we need to get 10 from smaller parts which can be directly achieved by using 10 itself.
So, the equation can be constructed as: (91 - 53) + 10 = 38 + 10 = 48. </think>
<answer>(91 - 53) + 10</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 26, 56, and 1 that equals 82, I need to consider how these numbers can be manipulated using basic arithmetic operations.
One useful strategy is to look for components that can be combined to reach 82. Given the numbers, if we add or subtract 26 and 56, we get 82 directly.
Let's consider the equation: 56 + 1 + 26
1. Adding 56 and 26: 56 + 26 = 82
2. Adding 1 to the result: 82 + 1 = 83
However, 83 is not our target. It appears that adding one of the numbers directly isn't working to produce exactly 82. 
Let's reconsider another strategy:
Instead of trying to reach 82 directly by combining the numbers, let's adjust our operation. Given that 56 is quite close to 82, it seems likely that using subtraction and then addition might work.
3. Subtracting 1 from 56: 56 - 1 = 55
4. Adding 27 to 55: 55 + 27 = 82
5. But 27 is not given. We can get 27 by combining the numbers again, thinking about multiplication and addition.
6. Multiplying 26 by 1: 26 * 1 = 26
7. Adding 56 to 26: 56 + 26 = 82
Thus, we now have an equation that works: (26 * 1) + 56 = 82
</think>
<answer>(26 * 1) + 56</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 87, 83, and 44 exactly once. I'll start by examining the numbers and looking for possible operations.
87 - 83 = 4, 44 - 87 = -44, 44 - 83 = -39.
None of these produce the number 48. Let's consider another approach, such as combining multiplication and subtraction.
(87 - 44) * 1 = 43, which is too small and does not include all numbers.
Let's try (87 - 44) * 2 = 104 which is too large.
Let's look closer: 83 - (87 - 44) = 83 - 43 = 40. Now, let's try to incorporate the last number by adjusting again.
If we add or subtract, I might think of adding 83 - 44 + something = 48. Already, we have 83 - 44 = 39, so we need +9 more to make 48. 9 - 44 = -35 (not applicable), but if we did (87 - 44) + 43, we're very close! Let me refine this:
83 - (87 - 44) + 43 = 83 - 43 + 43 = 83 - 43 + 43 = 83. This is also not correct as we need 83 - (44 + 14) = 45, which is too large.
I'm realizing the simplest way is to use a more straightforward approach with multiplication and subtraction.
(87 * 1) - (83 + 44) = 87 - 127 = -40, which is too negative.
I should try reversing to add numbers and then subtract:
(87 + 44) - 83 = 131 - 83 = 48.
This finally gives the required result of 48 using all three numbers only once with basic arithmetic operations.
</think>
<answer> (87 + 44) - 83 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the requirement to use each number [70, 82, 76] exactly once with the basic arithmetic operations. We want to end up with the result 64.
Looking at the numbers, we can see 76 is closest to 64, so we might subtract 12 from 76 to get 64. To get 12, we can use the other two numbers. 82 minus 70 equals 12.
Therefore, the equation will be 76 - (82 - 70) = 64.
</think>
<answer> 76 - (82 - 70) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get as close to 83 as possible using the numbers 66, 53, and 36. I see that 66 is the largest number, which could help me get closer to 83.
- If I add 53 to 66, I get 119, which is too high but it's closer. The difference is 119 - 83 = 36. 
- From the remaining 36, I can subtract the last 36 to reach 83. This gives me the equation 66 + 53 - 36 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 53 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 90, 52, 8, and 11 that equals 41, we can start by examining if any combination of these numbers or operations can get us close to 41.
- The sum of 90 and 52 is 142, which looks promising because it's high enough to potentially have room for subtraction or division.
- If we subtract 8 and 11 from 142, we would get 123 (142 - 8 - 11 = 123).
- To reach 41 from 123, we need to divide 123 by 3, which gives us exactly 41.
Therefore, the equation is 142 - 8 - 11 / 3 = 41.
However, we need to utilize the numbers 90, 52, 8, and 11 in their given form. 142 is not in our set of numbers. So, let's try another approach.
- The product of 90 and 52 is 4680, which is too high.
- If we subtract 52 from 90, we get 38.
- Then, using 8 and 11, the only way to turn 38 into 41 by adding or subtracting is to add 3 (11 - 8 = 3), which is part of our number set.
So, putting it together, we have: 90 - 52 + (11 - 8) = 90 - 52 + 3 = 38 + 3 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 52 + (11 - 8) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 19, 42, and 3. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, and the result should be 20.
One way to approach it is to try to combine the larger numbers first and then use the smaller one to reach the target.
3 is the smallest number, so we'll add a small adjustment with another number to get closer to 20.
If we subtract 3 from 42, we get 39. Then, if we subtract 19 from 39, we get 20. So the equation would be 42 - 19 - 3 = 20.
</think>
<answer> 42 - 19 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 26, 85, and 47 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to get 64. 
- First, 47 seems like a good starting point because it is relatively close to 64 and can be used as a base.
- Next, I see that 85 is quite far from 64, and it can only be subtracted or added once, but subtracting 85 would move us even further away from 64, so that's not useful for this.
- Therefore, I will use 85 as a part of a subtraction with 47.
- If I subtract 47 from 85, I get 38, which is now part of a number calculation with the remaining 26.
- I can get 64 by adding 26 to 38.
- Now, I'll formulate this into an equation: 85 - 47 + 26 = 64.
</think>
<answer> 85 - 47 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the goal: we need an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 90, 59, and 47 exactly once, with each number used only once. 
- Notice that 90 is a large number, and we need to reduce it to 78.
- One obvious direction could be to use 90 - some other number to get 78. But 90 minus any of these numbers (59 or 47) is not 78.
- Now, let's try subtracting smaller numbers. 90 - 59 = 31, which is not 78.
- Next, let's consider 90 - 47. This equals 43, not 78.
- Given that direct subtraction doesn't work and we need to use division as well, let's try division. 59 / 47 is approximately 1. 24, which is not very useful.
- Another thinkable way is trying 90 / some number equals 78, but 90 is not divisible by 78 easily.
- Now, let's consider multiplication and subtraction together: 90 - (number * another number) = 78.
- Trying 90 - (47 * number) suggests number could be 1 since 47 * 1 = 47. This means 90 - 47 = 43, which is not 78.
- Rearranging, 59 / 47 ≈ 1. 24, and 90 - 1. 24 * 47 gives a solution closer to 78.
- Furthermore, 59 / 47 ≈ 1. 24 and 90 - (59 / 47) = 90 - 1. 24 * 47 = 90 - 59 ≈ 31.
Given the above analysis, the best approach might be to adjust by adding some number and then subtracting it making it work.
- Trying 90 - 47 / 2 = 90 - 23. 5 = 66. 5 which is not 78.
- Trying a different approach, 90 - (59 - 47) = 90 - 12 = 78 which is correct.
So, the equation works out to be 90 - (59 - 47) = 78.
</think>
<answer> 90 - (59 - 47) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 34, 95, and 70 which equals 59. One strategy is to consider if any of the numbers can be used in a subtraction operation to get closer to 59, and then use the remaining value with another operation.
95 is the largest number and seems to be a good candidate for subtraction. If we subtract 70 from 95, we get 25. Now we need to get to 59 and have 25, which would mean we need 34 (59 - 25 = 34). Using the number 34, we can see that 25 + 34 = 59. Thus, the equation will be: 95 - 70 + 34 = 59.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 70 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 83, 99, and 67 exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 83. 
One way to approach this could be to consider if the number 83 could be achieved by subtracting or adding one of the numbers to/from another number.
- If we subtract 67 from 99, we get 32.
- If we subtract 32 from 83, we get 51.
- However, 51 is not 83.
- Now, let's try a different approach: if we take 83 minus 67, we get 16.
- Then, we can think if 67 + 16 equals another number that when subtracted from a second number gives us 83.
- 67 + 16 equals 83.
- Thus, we can consider the equation 67 + (99 - 83).
</think>
<answer> 67 + (99 - 83) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations and combinations that could lead to 72 using the digits 9, 18, 12, and 25 exactly once. The number 18 is a strong candidate as it's close to 72, so it might be useful to divide or subtract from it.
Let's see if we can create 72 from 18 and other numbers. We have 25 and 9, and 12 too.
One possible approach is 18 * (25 - 9 - 12) = 18 * 4 = 72.
Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Calculate 25 - 9 - 12 = 4.
2. Then calculate 18 * 4 = 72.
Each number is used exactly once, and the equation equals 72.
</think>
<answer> 18 * (25 - 9 - 12) </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 96 using the numbers 80, 16, and 11 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I'll start by assessing the numbers:
- One way to get a larger number could be by multiplying.
- The number 80 seems like a good starting point since it is relatively close to 96.
- Given the second number, 16, it could be useful as division or addition.
- The third number, 11, seems better to be combined with other numbers optimally.
I notice that 80 is 4 times 16, so 16 * 11 will give a result close to 80 but slightly lower. Next, to get closer to 96, I would aim to add 16 to the result. Therefore:
16 * 11 = 176 (this gives a very close sum to 96).
176 - 80 = 96 (which is exactly what we need).
So, the equation is 16 * 11 - 80 = 96.
</think>
<answer> 16 * 11 - 80 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the number 47 using the numbers 92, 50, and 5 exactly once, I need to consider the operations that might lead to this result. 
First, notice that 92 and 50 are quite large numbers, so we could subtract 50 from 92, which gives us 42. 
Then, I need to get from 42 to 47. Adding 5 to 42 equals 47. 
Therefore, the equation can be constructed as: 92 - 50 + 5 = 47.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 50) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use 53, 70, and 66 in some arithmetic operation to get 83. 
I can start by looking at the number 70, it's the closest to 83.
70 - 53 = 17
Now I have 17 and 66. 
If I add 17 to 66, I get:
17 + 66 = 83
This gives me the equation:
66 + (70 - 53) = 83
</think>
<answer> 66 + (70 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> We are given the numbers 72, 98, and 61, and we need to generate an equation that equals 87 using these numbers along with basic arithmetic operations. Looking at the numbers, we can use a combination that might include subtraction.
- Starting with subtraction, we see that 98 and 72 could be manipulated to get 26 (98 - 72 = 26).
- Then, we would need to add 61 to 26 to get 87 (26 + 61 = 87).
This suggests the equation would be something like: (98 - 72) + 61 = 87.
</think>
<answer>(98 - 72) + 61</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 72, 98, and 61 in such a way that they result in 87. Let's consider the operations we can use:
- 72 + 15 is 87, which isn't directly possible with the given numbers and operation.
- 98 - 11 is 87, but 11 isn't among the numbers.
- Multiplying and dividing the numbers either alone or in combinations doesn't directly produce 87 using the available numerals.
- Considering the subtraction of 98 by 15 equals 83 which is close but not the solution.
The only feasible option left would be to take 98 - 72 = 26 and then adjust that with the remaining number. 
26 + 61 equals 87 which fits the criteria. But this seems like overthinking as 72 - 61 = 11, 98 - 11 = 87 directly.
98 - 72 equals 26 and 26 + 61 equals 87.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 72 + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 96, 35, and 11. We need to create an expression that equals 72 using these numbers exactly once and with the basic arithmetic operations.

One approach could be to subtract 35 from 96 and then add 11 to see if we can get 72. That would be: 96 - 35 + 11.

Let's calculate this: 
96 - 35 = 61
Then 61 + 11 = 72

So, the expression that equals 72 using the numbers 96, 35, and 11 exactly once is 96 - 35 + 11.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 35 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 96, 34, and 7 using basic arithmetic operations to make 55. I'll start by considering if subtraction, addition, or a combination of both might work.
96 - 34 = 62, which is too high.
Let's try 96 - 34 + 7. This equals 69.
This is still too high, so I’ll try another combination. Let's see if subtracting 34 from 96 and then adding 7 gives us 55. I'll calculate: 
96 - 34 = 62
62 + 7 = 69
69 is still too high. Now, let's try 96 - (34 + 7) = 96 - 41 = 55.
This equals 55! Thus, the combination 96 - (34 + 7) fulfills the criteria. </think>
<answer> (96 - (34 + 7)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 96, 34, and 7. 
To get a result of 55, we should look at combinations involving multiplication and subtraction.
96 divided by 34 is approximately 2. 82, which is not close to 55.
Considering the subtraction, we can check if 96 - 34 = 62 is close and if we can use 7 to adjust this to 55.
Indeed, 96 - 34 = 62. Now subtracting 7 from this result: 62 - 7 = 55.
So, we have the equation: 96 - 34 - 7 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 34 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to explore combinations of the numbers 6, 24, and 7 using basic arithmetic operations to get as close to 37 as possible.
- If I start with the largest number 24, I can subtract or add smaller numbers around it.
- Subtracting: 24 - 6 = 18, which is far from 37.
- Adding: 24 + 11, but 11 is not available.
- Multiplying: 24 * 1.5 is not an integer and not between 24 and 37.
- Dividing: 24 / 0.75 = 32 which is too low, and 24 / 0.875 = 27. 14 is also too low.
- Now, let's multiply by the remaining number 7 and add or subtract 6: 
  - 24 * 7 = 168, which is far from 37 and unnecessary.
  - 24 * 7 - 6 = 168 - 6 = 162, still too high.
  - 24 * 7 + 6 = 168 + 6 = 174, still too high.
- Now, let's reconsider using addition: 
  - 24 + 7 + 6 = 37, which is the correct result.
</think>
<answer> 24 + 7 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 70, 72, and 58 only once, I need to think about different combinations of operations.
Let's consider the relationship between these numbers. If we add 70 and 72, we get 142, which is far from 84.
If we subtract 58 from 72, we get 14, and adding 70 to that gives us 84. So the equation would be 72 - 58 + 70 = 84.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 58 + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers [10, 5, 26] to get 76. One might consider multiplication as it could help reach the target number more quickly.
- If I use 26 as is, then I need to make 50 from 10 and 5.
- We know that 10 + 5 = 15.
- To get 50, I can use 10*5, which indeed equals 50.
- Therefore, the equation combining all elements would be 10*5 + 26 = 50 + 26 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (10 * 5) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> The target number is 80 and the numbers we have are 5, 28, and 47. 
Let's try to add or multiply and see if any combination gets us close to 80.
1. Adding 47 and 28 gives us 75 which is close, but less than 80.
2. Now, if we add 5 to 75, we get 80. 
So, the equation should be 47 + 28 + 5 = 80.
</think>
<answer> 47 + 28 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 91 using the numbers 77, 93, and 75, one approach would be to see if we can subtract one number or a combination of the numbers to get close to 91 and then use another number to achieve the exact result.
We can start by trying subtractions:
- 93 - 77 = 16, which is not equal to 91.
- 93 - 75 = 18, which is also not equal to 91.
- 77 - 75 = 2, which is not equal to 91 either.
The next step would be to try other combinations using the addition of these values. If we can add some numbers to reach 91:
- 77 + 93 = 170, which is too large.
- 77 + 75 = 152, which is still too large.
Let's consider the subtraction of 75 from 77 or 93, and then adding the remaining value:
- 93 - 77 = 16, and then 16 + 75 = 91.
This works as 16 + 75 equals 91.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 77) + 75 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 5, and 2 that equals 27. One way to approach this is to think about what operations could bring us from numbers close to 27 towards the goal.
Considering the number 30, subtracting 5 or 2 will get us close to 27. However, 30 - 5 = 25, and 30 - 2 = 28. Neither of these results will give us 27.
Let's try another approach by considering the multiplication and addition. If we multiply 5 by 2, we get 10. Then if we subtract 30 - 10 = 20, we are still far from 27. 
So, let's try one last combination: 30 - 5 = 25, and if we take 25 - 2 = 23. This is closer, so we need to get from 23 to 27. We can do this by adding 4, but unfortunately, 4 is not in our available numbers.
Instead, let's consider the possibility of rearrangement or looking for an error. 27 can be derived by adding three numbers. One effective way is using the number 30 as 5*6 and the 5, so the equation would be 30 - 5 + 2.
30 - 5 equals 25, and 25 + 2 equals 27.
</think>
<answer> 30 - 5 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 32, 54, and 69 to create an equation that equals 17. I'll start by considering the possible combinations of these numbers using the basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding the numbers: 32 + 54 + 69 = 155 (not 17)
- Subtracting the numbers: The smallest number is 32, and the largest is 69, but even by using 69 - 32 = 37, we can't get to 17.
- Multiplying and dividing doesn't seem to help as well since the numbers are relatively large and the result would be either very large or a fraction, neither of which will give us 17.
- There's a chance we can use more than one of these operations, but given the numbers I have, the best course of action might be to subtract one large number from the sum of the other two.

Considering 54 + 32 = 86. If I subtract 69 from 86, I get 86 - 69 = 17, which is what we need.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 32 - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 63, 92, and 25 exactly once to get 54. Let's start by considering the target number 54. One obvious way to reach 54 is by subtracting from or adding to the given numbers. I'll start with subtractions as a potential strategy since 54 is much lower than 63 and 92.
Looking at the options, if I subtract 25 from 63, I get:
63 - 25 = 38
Now, I have 38 and 92, and I need to find a way to get to 54. Subtracting 92 from 38 will overshoot 54, so I try adding 92 instead.
92 + 38 = 130
This doesn't work because it's too large. There's no other operation or combination of the remaining numbers (38, 92, 25) that I can use to get to 54. This suggests a different approach may be needed.
I see that 63 is quite close to 54. So, if I subtract 92 from 63, I get:
63 - 92 = -29
This is negative, so it's not helping. Now, let's try a different combination:
I realize that I might have missed a combination of operations. Let's try a different approach by analyzing the numbers and target more closely. 
(I overlooked this earlier):
(92 - 63) + 25 = 19 + 25 = 44
This result, 44, is too low. Let's try subtracting 19 from 92 instead:
(92 - 63) + (92 - 63) = 29 + 29 = 58
Still not 54. Let's take a look at subtraction another way:
63 - (92 - 25) = 63 - 67 = -4
That's negative again. Now I think:
(92 + 25) - 63 = 117 - 63 = 54
Ah, this gives me the wanted result of 54! </think>
<answer>(92 + 25) - 63</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 78 using the numbers 21, 98, and 1. Considering that 98 is quite large and 1 is small and can be useful for adjustments.
Let's think about subtraction and addition. If I subtract 21 from 98, I get 77. This is close to 78. Now I need a way to make it 78. The only number I have left is 1, and adding 1 to 77 gives me 78.
So, the equation would be: 98 - 21 + 1 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 21 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 92, 55, and 62 that equals 99, I'll start by considering how I might reduce the numbers to get closer to 99. One way to approach this is to think about subtraction. If I can subtract a relatively small number from 92, it should help me close to the target.
If I subtract 55 from 92, I get 37. Now, I need to get from 37 to 99. To do this, I can add the remaining number, 62.
So the equation can be: 92 - 55 + 62 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 55 + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 99 using the numbers 31, 39, and 29 exactly once, I need to consider different combinations of basic arithmetic operations. I'll start by looking at the highest number, 39, as it might help balance the equation.
One way to approach this is by considering 39 as the largest component and subtracting or adding smaller numbers in a way that compensates to reach 99.
Let's first evaluate 39 - 29: This gives us 10. Now, we need to reach 89 (99 - 10) using 31.
Next, consider adding 31 to 10: This gives us 41. Now, we still need 48 (89 - 41) to reach 99.
Finally, we can see that 39 - 29 + 31 = 39.10, which doesn't quite give us 99 using our numbers. 
There's an alternative approach by considering multiplication as well: There's no direct multiplication of these numbers that gives us 99, so let's combine addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Let's see how 29 + 31 = 60, and then try to get to 39 using operations:
60 + 39 = 99
Thus, the equation that satisfies the given condition is: 29 + 31 + 39 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 29 + 31 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination that will give me 95 using the numbers 31, 87, 55, and 96. 
I notice that 96 is quite close to 95, and 96 - 95 = 1. This is a good clue.
Now, 96 - 95 = 1. I need to get 94 using the remaining number 31 and 55.
Looking at 31 + 55 = 86, we need 94 - 86 = 8.
But 55 - 8 = 47, which doesn't help directly.
Instead, I should consider rearranging: 96 - (87 - 55) + 31 = 95.
Calculating this:
96 - 32 + 31 = 95, which is correct.
So, the equation is 96 - (87 - 55) + 31 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 96 - (87 - 55) + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 79, 71, and 38 that equals 46. I should consider using combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with these numbers.
- First, I notice that 79 + 71 = 150, which is a bit too large, so I likely need to subtract some value.
- Next, if I subtract 144 (which is 79 + 71 - 38) from 38, I would get -106, far from 46. I need to adjust this approach.
- Now, let's try subtracting smaller numbers:
- If I use 79 - 71 + 38 = 46, this would give me the desired result of 46 exactly.
- Since all the numbers can only be used once, 79 - 71 + 38 is the right equation.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 71 + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 68, and 5 that equals 12. Let's work with these numbers.
- First, I should consider what basic arithmetic operations might be useful. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are all possible.
- I notice that 68 and 5 are quite large, while 75 is also quite significant. The sum of 75 and 5 is 80, which is too high, and simply using any one of these numbers already gives values far from 12.
- Considering the numbers closely, I notice that 75 and 5 can be combined in a way that might help. 75 - 68 = 7, which is further from 12. 
- However, let's try 75 - 68 + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12, which is exactly what we need.
- This combination meets the criteria as it uses each number exactly once and results in 12.
</think>
<answer> (75 - 68) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 40 using the three numbers, 58, 2, and 38. One approach is to try reducing the sum by combining operations on the numbers.
Looking at the numbers, 58 and 38 can be subtracted to get 20 (58 - 38 = 20). Now I have 20 and 2 left. To get to 40 from 20, I need to multiply by 2 (20 * 2 = 40). So the equation will be subtraction of 58 and 38, then multiplying the result by 2.
Therefore, the equation is (58 - 38) * 2.
</think>
<answer>(58 - 38) * 2</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 3, 48, and 92 that results in 41 using basic arithmetic operations, we need to consider the operations we can use (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and how we can strategically place the numbers.
First, let's see if multiplication or division can help us reach a target number closer to 41. Dividing 92 by 3 gives us 30.67, which is close but not an integer. Multiplying 92 by 3 gives us 276, which is much higher.
Next, let's consider using subtraction. If we subtract one number from another, we can try to end up near 41. If we subtract 48 from 92, we get 44, which is close to 41. Now, we need to find out how to get from 44 to 41 using the remaining numbers. We can subtract 3 from 44.
This gives us the equation: (92 - 48) - 3 = 41.
</think>
<answer>(92 - 48) - 3</answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 18, 95, and 28 exactly once to make 49. A good approach might be to consider subtraction for this problem.
- If we subtract 18 from 95, we get 77.
- Then, we would need to subtract 28 from 77 to reach 49.
- To achieve this, let's calculate 77 - 28 = 49.
Therefore, the equation is 95 - 18 - 28 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 18 - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the given numbers: 18, 95, and 28. We need to use these numbers to create an equation that equals 49. 
One effective way is to look for a number that we can subtract from 95 to get close to 49. 95 - 46 = 49, but we only have 18 and 28 left, and there's no way to get 46 using these.
Let's try another approach: 95 - 28 = 67. Now we need to get from 67 to 49 by using 18. If we subtract 18 from 67, we get 49. So the equation becomes 95 - 28 - 18 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 28 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 43 using the numbers 7, 13, and 37 with basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider how to combine these numbers.
One way to think about this is to see if any of the numbers can be combined with another in a way that results in a number close to 43. Notably, 13 + 37 = 50, which is close to 43.
Now we need another number to end up with 43. We have the number 7, and 43 - 50 = -7, which isn't directly useful. However, we can turn this into a positive by using subtraction in reverse, or by considering multiplication and subtraction in a different way.
Another approach is to see if we can multiply or divide the numbers to get a closer or a more complementary number. Multiplying 7 and 37 doesn't give us 43. Dividing 37 by 7 doesn't seem to work either.
Considering the numbers we have, the combination 50 - 7 = 43 seems to work: 13 + 37 = 50, and then we subtract 7.
</think>
<answer> (13 + 37) - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to combine the numbers 7, 13, and 37 using basic arithmetic operations to get 43. 
First, let's see if any combination of these numbers can sum to 43 on its own or if we can add/subtract one of them to reach the target.
One possible way is: 
13 + 37 - 7 = 43
Let's verify:
13 + 37 equals 50
Then subtracting 7 from 50 gives us 43, which matches our target.
So the equation that works is 13 + 37 - 7 = 43.
</think>
<answer> 13 + 37 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 51, 69, and 42 that equals 78. I should use each number exactly once and can use any combination of basic arithmetic operations.
I see that 69 - 51 = 18, which is a simpler number to work with. Then if I subtract 42 from 18, I get:
18 - 42 = -24, which is far from 78.
Next, let's try doing 69 - 42 = 27 and then see if we can get close to 78 with the remaining 51. 27 + 51 = 78, which is exactly what we need. The numbers 51, 69, 42 can be used in this order with these operations:
(69 - 42) + 51 = 78 </think>
<answer>(69 - 42) + 51</answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 86, 74, 14, and 56 that equals 90. One way to approach this is to consider which operations might lead to 90 when applied to these numbers.
Let's try some combinations:
- 86 - 74 = 12
- 12 + 14 = 26
- 26 + 56 = 82
This isn't quite 90, so maybe we're missing a crucial number or operation.
- 86 - 14 = 72
- 72 - 56 = 16
- 16 + 74 = 90
This gives us the equation 86 - 14 - 56 + 74 = 90.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 14 - 56) + 74 </answer>

==============
<think> We start with the numbers 71, 7, 15, and 22. We need to use them to get 41 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
First, notice that 71 is quite close to 74, and we can get 74 from 22 + 52. 52 is twice 26, and we need 26 by adding 7 and 19. 19 can be derived from 15 + 4. 4 can be derived from 7 - 3, but 3 can't be made with the given numbers. 
However, if we rearrange, 7 - (22 - 15) = 7 - 7 = 0, which isn't helping. A different approach seems necessary. Let's try another sequence: 
71 - 15 - 22 = 34, and we need 7 more to get to 41. So, we get (71 - (15 + 22)) + 7 = 41.
</think>
<answer> (71 - (15 + 22)) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation with the numbers 78, 98, and 62 that equals 82, I should consider each number and the operations available. A good approach is to reduce the sum or difference of these numbers trying to get closer to 82.
Looking at the numbers, 98 - 62 = 36. Now, if I add this result to 78, I get 36 + 78 = 114, which is too high. Next, I should try removing numbers or using subtraction.
98 - 62 - 78 would give me a negative number and exceeding 82, which doesn't seem promising. Instead, I can try:
98 - 78 = 20. Now, I need to get from 20 to 82 by adding some value. The number 20 + 62 = 82, which is exactly what I need.
So the equation becomes 98 - 78 + 62 = 82. </think>
<answer> 98 - 78 + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 72 using the numbers 10, 21, and 41 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).
First, I notice that 41 is very close to 72 - 31. So, I can subtract 31 from 72. Now I only need to find 31 in terms of 10 and 21.
I see that 21 + 10 = 31, which is exactly what I need.
Putting it all together, the equation becomes:
72 = 41 + (21 + 10)
</think>
<answer> 41 + (21 + 10) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 14 using the numbers 80, 4, and 62 exactly once, I'll need to carefully consider how to use the arithmetic operations.
I notice that 80 and 62 are relatively large numbers, and when combined with 4, we need to get a small result like 14. The obvious operation to use here is subtraction because it can significantly reduce the number.
Let's start with 80 - 62 = 18. Now, we need to get from 18 down to 14. Subtracting 4 from 18 would work, i.e., 18 - 4 = 14.
So the equation we need is 80 - 62 - 4 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 62 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 12, 7, and 70 exactly once to get 51. One way to approach this is to consider multiplication and addition since 70 is a large number that could contribute significantly to the sum. 
First, let's see if we can use 70 properly:
- If we multiply 70 by any number from the given set, 51 is less than 70, so this alone doesn't suffice.
Then, let's consider dividing 70 by a number:
- 70 divided by 7 equals 10, which is not 51 but it gives us how close we are to our target.
Now, we need to reach 41 more to get 51, and 12 is the only number left. Using 12, we can see:
- 70 - 12 = 58 is too much
- 70 - 12 / 70 = 70 - 0. 1714... is clearly not 51.
Finally, let's try another combination:
- We know 12 / 7 = approximately 1. 714, and then 70 - 2 (which is 12 / 7) = 68.
This is still not 51. 
Then, let's try 70 - (12 / 7 + 7) to get the sum:
- First, 12 / 7 = approximately 1. 714
- Then, 12 / 7 + 7 = 1. 714 + 7 = 8. 714
- Finally, 70 - 8. 714 = 61. 286, which isn't 51 either.
After these attempts, let's test the following equation:
- 70 - 12 - 7 = 51
This works because:
70 - 12 = 58  
58 - 7 = 51
So the equation is 70 - 12 - 7 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 12 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> To get to 92 using the numbers 17, 20, and 95 exactly once, we need to find an equation. The number 95 is quite large, so it might be used as a base number. Subtracting and adding 17 and 20 might be part of it.
1. First, let's consider the subtraction: 95 - 17 = 78.
2. Now, we need to get from 78 to 92. We can do this by adding 14. 
3. 14 is quite different from either 17 or 20, but we need to check if we can make 14 from 17, 20, and 95 using only addition and subtraction.
4. If we take 17 and subtract 95 or 20, we get negative numbers or numbers that cannot be used to form 14.
5. However, 20 - 95 is -77 and 17 - 20 is -3, both of which are not helpful.
6. Revisiting, perhaps combining operations like addition and subtraction of the three numbers, we can consider: 95 - 20 + 17 = 92.
This way, 95 is first subtracted by 20, leaving 75, which then, when 17 is added, equals 92.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 20 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 20, and 95 to equal 92. Let's evaluate what combinations we can make.
- First, let's see if there's a straightforward way to reach 92 using all these numbers directly.
- If I use 95, I can subtract 13 from it to get 92 (95 - 13 = 92), but 13 is not in the list of numbers given.
- I need to use 17 and 20 in some way to get 13. 
- Considering multiplication, 17 * 20 = 340 which is way too big.
- Considering division, 20 / 17 is approximately 1.18 which isn't helpful.
- Considering addition and subtraction of 17 and 20, it's difficult to get the exact value without using one of the given numbers more than once. 
- The only viable option might be looking at how 20 can interact with 95 and subtraction.
- 95 - 20 = 75, and then we would need 75 - 83 to get to 92, which is not possible without using extra numbers.
- Another option to consider is the order in which we subtract. If we start subtracting 17 from 95, then subtract 20, it could work:
  95 - 17 = 78, and then 78 - 20 = 58, and this is still not 92.
- But, let's rethink it by adding back numbers we subtracted. If 95 - 20 = 75, and then when 17 is added to the result:
  95 - 20 + 17 = 75 + 17 = 92.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 20 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 89, 36, and 34 exactly once to get 91 as the result. 
One possible approach is to consider if I can get close to 91 with a combination of the numbers and then adjust using the allowable operations. 

89 + 34 = 123 (too high)
36 + 34 = 70 (too low)
89 - 34 = 55 (I'm getting closer, but still too high)
When I add 36 to 55, I get 91 exactly!

So the equation will be: 89 - 34 + 36 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 34 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 34, 9, and 3 exactly once, I need to consider possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One possible approach is to start with the largest number, 34, and see if we can use the other numbers to reach the target.
If we add 9 to 34, we get 43, which is close to 40 but over. Since we can't adjust this further with our remaining number 3, let's try subtracting 3 from 43 instead.
43 - 3 = 40.
This gives us our solution.
</think>
<answer> (34 + 9) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 20 using the numbers 18, 11, 81, and 59 exactly once, I need to consider how these numbers can combine using basic arithmetic operations.
One useful approach is to look for a combination where subtraction and addition can be strategically used.
If I take 81 and subtract 59, I get 22. Now I need to get from 22 to 20 with the remaining numbers 18 and 11. Subtracting 2 from 22 gives me 20. I can achieve this by subtracting 11 and then 1. Since 11 - 11 = 0, we need to add 1 back in another way.
11 - 11 + 18 - 1 = 20
However, I realize that adding another 1 directly isn't possible with just the numbers 18 and 11. I need to adjust this approach.
Considering just using 18 and 2:
18 - 11 + 11 = 8, and to reach 20, I need:
18 - 11 + 11 + 8 = 20
But I have the number 81 unused and can't fit it into the equation directly. Let's try another straightforward approach:
18 + 11 - 59 + 2 = 20, but 2 is not in the list.
18 + 11 - 59 + 1 = 20, but 1 is not available.
Instead, let's use division and subtraction in a new attempt:
(81 - 59) / 11 = 2. Using this, now we need:
2 + 18 = 20
So putting this all together:
(81 - 59) / 11 + 18 = 20
</think>
<answer> (81 - 59) / 11 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 35, 16, and 97 that equals 46. We should consider addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's check for any possible direct use of these operations. Adding or subtracting any two of these numbers from the third doesn't give us 46.
Multiplying or dividing these numbers also doesn't seem to work directly to reach 46.
Now, let's consider rearrangement and combination of operations. If we subtract 16 from 35, we get 19. Now we need 27 more to reach 46. Dividing 97 by 3 (as 97 ÷ 3 = 32. 33, which isn't an integer and not our case) or another operation may work.
However, if we consider 97 - 35 = 62, and then subtract 16 from 62, we get 46.
So, 97 - 35 - 16 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 35 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 35, 16, and 97 that equals 46. We can perform basic arithmetic operations with each number only once.
One approach is to consider whether any of the numbers can be used as it is or combined in some way to get closer to 46.
Starting with 97, if we subtract 51 from it, we get 46: 97 - 51 = 46.
We need to find 51 using the other two numbers, 35 and 16. We can try simple operations:
35 + 16 = 51.
So we have successfully created our equation.
</think>
<answer> 97 - (35 + 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 62, 49, and 66 to get 45. 
62 + 49 = 111 is too high, 66 - 49 = 17 is too low.
Considering the target number is 45, it seems necessary to use subtraction. 
Let's first try to adjust 62 to make it closer to 45 by subtracting 17 (66 - 49), which gives us:
62 - (66 - 49) = 62 - 17 = 45
So we can rewrite the equation using the numbers 62, 49, and 66 in a way that 66 - 49 equals 17, and then subtracting this from 62 gives us our target number 45.
</think>
<answer> 62 - (66 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 81, 99, and 17 to get 35. A good strategy could be using subtraction and addition.
Looking at the numbers, 99 - 81 = 18, which is close to 35 but not quite there.
18 + 17 = 35, which gives us our target.
So the equation is 99 - 81 + 17 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 81 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 84, 90, and 97 that equals 91, I will use a combination of arithmetic operations. 
First, I'll consider what operations could logically bring these numbers close to 91. 
The number 97 is the largest, so let's start by subtracting it from 90 or 84 to use the difference in the operation.
If I subtract 97 - 90, I get -7. 
This suggests using 84 - (-7) or simply 84 + 7 to reach a positive target.
If I add 7 to 84, I get 91. 
So the equation would be 84 + (97 - 90).
</think>
<answer> 84 + (97 - 90) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 26, 76, 39, and 90 once each to get 27. 
Let's consider using subtraction and division. One approach could be:
76 - 39 - 90/26
If we evaluate this expression:
76 - 39 = 37
90 / 26 is approximately 3. 46, which when subtracted from 37 gives us:
37 - 3. 46 = 33. 54
This doesn't equal 27, so this option isn't right.
Instead, let's try:
(90 - 76) / 39 + 26
If we evaluate this expression:
90 - 76 = 14
14 / 39 approximately equals 0. 35, and when adding 26:
0. 35 + 26 = 26. 35
This also doesn't equal 27. 
Finally, let's try:
90 - 76 + 39 / 26
If we evaluate this expression:
90 - 76 = 14
39 / 26 = 1. 5, and adding it to 14:
14 + 1. 5 = 15. 5
This still doesn't give us 27.
We've tried several approaches and none seem to work, let's try a different combination:
39 + 90 - 76 - 26
If we evaluate this expression:
39 + 90 = 129
129 - 76 = 53
53 - 26 = 27
This gives us the desired result of 27.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 90 - 76 - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 75, 98, and 15 to make an equation that equals 38. 
First, let's consider the feasibility of using each number in the final equation.
75, 98, and 15 do not seem to combine directly into 38. 
Looking more closely:
- 98 could be broken down or subtracted in a way that might give 38.
- Adding or subtracting 15 to/from the other numbers does not seem likely to reach 38.
Let's try combining 15 and 75 first:
15 + 75 = 90, but that's too large. Let's try 75 - 15 = 60, which is also too large.
75 - 98 would give -23, which is not useful.
Instead, I'll consider using 98 and 15 in a different way.
If we take 98 - 15 = 83, now we need to reduce it to 38, this can be done by subtracting another number.
Since 83 - 45 = 38, and 45 could be obtained from 15 + 30, and 30 from 98 - 68, but we only have 15 and 98 available.
Let's try: 
98 - (15 + 75 / 15) = 98 - (15 + 5) = 98 - 20 = 78, which is still too big.
Let's try: 
98 - (15 + (75 / (98-15))) Which simplifies it as:
98 - (15 + (75 / 83)) = 98 - (15 + 0. 9035)) = 98 - 15. 9035 = 82. 0965
This is not exactly 38. 
We need another method to reduce 83 to 38. We need to re-arrange. 
Taking 98 - 60 = 38, as 60 can be derived from 75-15.
So, the final equation that works is: 98 - 75 + 15 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 75 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> To get to 85 using the numbers 26, 99, 71, and 31 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's see if we can start with additions and subtractions:
- Trying to add and subtract 26 and 71 to get close to 85, we get: 26 + 71 = 97. If we subtract 31 from this, we get 66, which is too low.
- Let's try subtracting 99 instead of adding it: 26 + 71 - 99 = 38, which is still not 85.
Next, let's test multiplication and division:
- Multiplying 26 by 31 gives 794, which is too high. Dividing these gives us values far from 85.
- If we divide 71 by 31, we get 2.3, not making a significant difference.
- Looking at other pairs, 71 * 31 = 2201, which is far away.
It seems we need to re-evaluate the order and combination of operations.
Let's try other orders:
- 99 - 71 = 28. Now we need 85 - 28 = 57. 31 - 26 = 5. So 28 + (31 - 26) = 5 + 28 = 33. This is still not working.
However, I notice I overlooked a simpler solution:
- 99 - 71 = 28. Now we need 85 - 28 = 57. 57 can be broken down as 26 + 31 = 57.
Thus, the equation using all numbers and operations correctly is:
99 - 71 + 26 + 31 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 71 + 26 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 69, 53, and 62. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 60.
- 69 + 53 = 122 (which is close but too high)
- 69 - 53 = 16 (which is close but too low)
- 69 * 53 and 62 * any of these are clearly not going to result in 60

Now let's try something different:
- 69 + 53 - 62
- This simplifies to 122 - 62 = 60
This gives us the equation 69 + 53 - 62 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 53 - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 17, 37, and 58 exactly once to get 78. 
First, I should consider if any combination of these numbers directly gives 78. 
37 + 58 = 95, which is close but too high.
37 + 17 = 54, which is too low.
Now, let's try another combination: 58 - 37 = 21. 
If I use the remaining number 17, I can see that 21 + 17 = 38, which is still too low.
To reach 78, I need to add more. 
58 - 37 + 17 = 38, so I need another 40.
If 58 - 37 = 21 and 17 + 21 = 38, then 78 = 21 + 38 is not possible directly.
Instead, 21 + 78 = 99, which is too high.
Let's re-evaluate: 58 + 37 - 17 = 78, as 58 + 37 = 95 and subtracting 17 from 95 gives 78.
So, we get the equation 58 + 37 - 17 = 78. </think>
<answer> 58 + 37 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to somehow get 29 using the numbers 23, 35, and 41 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. One way it could work is if one of these numbers cancels out with another in a clever way.
If I look at the difference between 41 and 35, I get 6. Then if I subtract this difference (6) from 23, I get 23 - 6 = 17, which is not the answer we need. Next, if I add 17 to 35, I get 52, which is not 29 either.
Let's try taking the difference of 41 and 23, which gives me 18. Now if I add this 18 to 35, I get 18 + 35 = 53, which is still not 29.
Then, let's think of a way to balance things out. If I use the difference of 35 and 23 (12), and use it with the remaining number 41, I can make it work:
41 - (35 - 23) = 41 - 12 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 41 - (35 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 79, 91, and 86 that equals 74. Each number can only be used once and basic arithmetic operations are allowed.
- If I subtract 86 from 91, I get 91 - 86 = 5.
- Now, if I subtract 5 from 79, I get 79 - 5 = 74.
So, the equation would be 79 - (91 - 86) = 74.
</think>
<answer> 79 - (91 - 86) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 33, 90, and 90 to get to 32 using basic arithmetic operations. One way to approach this is to think about what we can subtract from the larger numbers to get closer to 32. Subtracting 90 from 90 doesn't help, as it brings us to 0. Let's see if we can do something creative with the 33 and the 90s.
One possibility is to use the 33 and the 90s together. Since 90 - 33 = 57, and 57 - 90 = -33 doesn't help, let's try another combination.
Consider 90 / 90 = 1. Subtracting 1 from 33 gives us 33 - 1 = 32, which is exactly what we need.
So the equation would be: 33 - 90 / 90 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 33 - 90 / 90 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 80 using the numbers 37, 84, 13, and 46 exactly once, I'll start by considering the larger numbers. Notice that 84 - 37 = 47, which is close to 80. If only we could get from 47 to 80 by subtracting or adding the other numbers, that would work.
Let's see if we can get 33 from 46 and 13 by subtracting. 46 - 13 = 33. Now we need to get from 33 to 80 by operation with 47. Indeed, 47 + 33 = 80. This gives us the equation.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 37) + (46 - 13) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 30, 59, and 4 with basic arithmetic operations to get 33. 
First, notice that 59 is quite close to 33, which could be a clue. 
Let's try to subtract 4 from 59 and see what we get: 59 - 4 = 55. 
That doesn't help directly, as it's too large. 
However, by subtracting 30 from 59, we get 59 - 30 = 29. 
Now, 29 + 4 = 33, which matches our target. 
So the equation is: 59 - 30 + 4 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 30 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 33 using the numbers 30, 59, and 4. The number 59 is quite large and would skew the result too high, so let's see if we can use it in a subtraction. 
59 - 30 = 29, which is close to 33. Now we need an additional 4 to reach 33. We have the number 4 available, so we can use that directly.
Therefore, the equation will be: 29 + 4 = 33.
However, our step shows that we could achieve 29 using 59 - 30. So, let's use the smaller number 4 with 29.
The complete equation becomes: (59 - 30) + 4 = 33.
</think>
<answer>(59 - 30) + 4</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 59, and 4 that equals 33. Let's try to use the operations in a way that could yield our desired result.
Starting with the number 4, if I take 4 away from 59, I get 55.
Next, if I subtract 30 from 55, I get 25, which is not 33.
However, I can do the opposite - if I take 30 from 59, I get 29.
Now, if I add 4 to 29, I get 33, which is what we need.
So the equation will be (59 - 30) + 4 = 33.
</think>
<answer> (59 - 30) + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 67, 39, and 48 to create an equation that equals 20. The goal is to arrange them using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider if any combination of these numbers through simple operations could result in 20.
Let's see:
- 67 - 39 = 28, which is close but not what we need.
- 67 - 39 + 48 = 76, which is too large.
- 67 + 39 - 48 = 58, which is also too large.
- 67 + 39 - 48 does not work for 20 directly.
- Let's try 39 + 48 - 67: This equals 20. It is valid as all numbers are used once and each operation is basic.
This gives us the equation: 39 + 48 - 67 = 20.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 48 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 6, 31, and 57 that equals 32. 
I notice that 57 - 31 = 26, which is close to 32. 
We can then adjust it by adding or subtracting another small number.
32 can be reached by adding 6 to 26.
So our equation will be: (57 - 31) + 6 = 32.
</think>
<answer>(57 - 31) + 6</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use 7, 94, and 55 to get to 46. One effective way is to consider subtraction and addition.
Starting with 94 and 55, if I subtract 55 from 94, I get:
94 - 55 = 39
Now I need to get from 39 to 46. This means I need to add 7 to 39.
So, 39 + 7 = 46.
Therefore, the equation is 94 - 55 + 7 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 55 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use 36, 2, and 39 to make 73. Let's try to use the largest number, 39, first as it will help us get closer to 73.
39 + 2 = 41.
Now we need 32 more to reach 73.
Since 36 is available and 36 - 4 = 32, we can use that.
So the equation would be 36 - 2 + 39.
</think>
<answer> 36 - 2 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 91, and 77 that equals 26. One approach is to think about how these numbers might be manipulated through basic arithmetic operations.
First, 40 - 77 = -37, which is not helpful for reaching 26.
Trying 91 - 40 = 51, which is also not leading us closer to 26.
Now, let's try rearranging: (91 - 77) + 40. This simplifies to 14 + 40.
14 + 40 = 54, which is still not 26.
Next, let's try the reverse of our current thinking: we'll use 77 - 91 + 40. This simplifies to -14 + 40.
-14 + 40 = 26.
Thus, our equation is 77 - 91 + 40 = 26.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 91 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 82, 44, and 60 exactly once, I need to consider how these numbers can be manipulated with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach could be to subtract the smallest number from the sum of the other two, and then add a number to get to 98.
Considering 60 + 44 = 104, if I subtract 82 from 104, I get 22. To reach 98 from 22, I need to add 76, but 76 can't be made from 44 and 60 using only addition or subtraction. However, I need to rearrange this slightly.
Another approach could be to use multiplication and then subtraction. If I multiply 44 and 60 and then subtract 82, I get: 44 * 60 = 2640 - 82 = 2558, which is far from 98. This approach doesn't work either.
Lastly, I consider if I might be able to use division. 60 divided by 44 is approximately 1.36 (approximately, since we are dealing with whole numbers), but 82 divided by this result would not yield a simple solution with whole numbers.
After trying different combinations, a suitable equation comes to mind. If I add 44 to 60 and then subtract 82:
60 + 44 = 104
104 - 82 = 22
This is still not 98. However, 98 - 22 = 76, and 76 can be expressed as 44 * 1.75 (though we only work with whole numbers).
Given that 44 * 1.75 is close to 44 + 82 - 44 = 82 - 44 = 38 (a step towards an 82 equivalent) and 60 - 44 = 16 (a consistent answer), a valid equation using our numbers exactly once and arithmetic operations would be:
60 + 44 - 82 = 22, which is not 98, we need to make changes.
Let's use 44 + 60 = 104, then 104 - 82 = 22, needing to reach 98, we correct by 76. Since 44 is too small, let’s try a simple correction: 82 - (44 - 60) = 82 - (-20) = 102, still going high.
On reevaluation, if we look: 60+ 44 - 82 = 22, still not 98. Need correction.
Finally, correctly applying: 44 + 60 - 82 = 22, and noticing we miss a simple multi-step operation fixing it: 82 + (60 - 44) = 98.
</think>
<answer> 82 + (60 - 44)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 22, 12, 93, and 18 that equals 65. I'll start by looking at the numbers and considering the operations that might lead to 65.
Notice that 93 is quite close to 65, so subtracting 28 might help.
Seeing 18, this could be one of the numbers used to reach 28.
28 = 22 + 18 - 12
So the equation becomes:
93 - (22 + 18 - 12) = 65
This matches our target number 65.
</think>
<answer> 93 - (22 + 18 - 12) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 83, and 86 that equals 48. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 83 - 86 = -3 (not close to 48)
- 83 - 45 = 38 (not 48)
- 45 - 83 = -38 (not 48, but in negative)
- 45 - 83 + 86 = 48 (this looks promising)
So, the equation is 45 - 83 + 86 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 45 - 83 + 86 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 16, 1, and 46 to create an equation that equals 31. Let's start by considering what operations could bring us closer to 31.
The number 46 is quite large, and 1 is very small, so using subtraction or division with these numbers alone may not get us to 31 easily. Adding 46 to any of the other numbers would exceed 31, so we might need to consider multiplication or division first.
We could try to subtract a smaller number from a larger one. If we take 46 and subtract 16, we get 30, which is close to 31. We just need to add 1 more. And we already have a 1 to use in our equation.
So the equation could be: 46 - 16 + 1. Let's calculate it.
46 - 16 = 30
30 + 1 = 31
</think>
<answer> 46 - 16 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 95, and 30 exactly once to get a result of 15. 
One way to approach this is to consider basic operations. If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one, we might get closer to 15. We should try 95 - 50 = 45, but that's too large.
Instead, let's consider 95 - 30 = 65. Now if we subtract 50 from this result, we might get closer to 15. So, 65 - 50 = 15.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 30) - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 95, and 30 exactly once to make 15. Let's consider different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
First, 95 is a large number, so subtracting 50 from it would give us 45, which is too large.
Next, let's consider multiplying or dividing. If we divide 50 by 30, we get approximately 1.67, which is not close to 15. If we try to use subtraction, we can think about 95 - 50 = 45, which again seems too large.
The number 30 is a good candidate for subtraction because 95 - 30 = 65, which is still much larger than 15. Considering these operations, it seems like addition or subtraction in other combinations might be necessary.
We need to get from a number close to 15, so let's try removing parts of the larger numbers to come closer. Subtracting 30 from 50 gives us 20. Subtracting 30 from 95 and then adding that result to 20 could work. 95 - 30 = 65, and 65 + 20 = 85, which is far from 15.
We also should try different permutations. What if we start with 95 - 50 = 45 and then subtract 30 from it: 45 - 30 = 15. This gives us the number 15 exactly.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 50 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 13, 61, and 9 exactly once to get 39. 
First, let's consider the larger number 61. This is quite close to 39, and if we can find a way to subtract a small number to get the desired result, we might have our solution.
If I subtract 13 from 61, I get 48, which is too high but close. Now, if I add 9 to 48, I get 57, which is still too high.
If I add 9 to 48, I don't reach 39, and if I subtract more from 61, I overshoot quickly.
Instead, let's try a different approach. I can subtract 9 from 61 to get 52, and then subtract another 13 to get 39. This gives us the equation: 61 - 9 - 13 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 61 - 9 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 13, 61, and 9 to create an expression that equals 39. Let's consider all the possible combinations using basic arithmetic operations.
- Multiplying and adding/subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to suffice to reach 39.
- One useful combination could be using the number 61 as a base number and adjusting with 13 and 9 to reach 39.
- If I subtract 13 from 61, I get 48. Then, I need 39, which is 9 less than 48. So, the combination could be 61 - 13 - 9 = 39.
</think>
<answer> (61 - 13) - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 72 using the numbers 78, 21, and 27 exactly once with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, I need to consider the relationships between the numbers.
By examining the numbers, it seems that 78 and 27 have a simple subtraction relationship (78 - 27 = 51). Now, if we can use 21 in some way to get 72 from 51, we might find a solution.
Let's think about dividing 51 by 3 and then add 21 to it: (51 / 3) + 21 = 17 + 21 = 38, which is not 72. We need to try reorienting the operations.
Another approach could be to make use of 21 to reach other numbers. Instead, let's try performing 21 * 3 = 63, and then adding 27 to get 72: 63 + 27 = 90 - 18, but this doesn't directly use 21.
We might notice that 78 - 27 - 21 = 30 is not the answer either.
Finally, consider if multiplying can be useful. If (78 - 27) * (21 / 3) = 51 * 7 = 357 is not the answer.
After careful consideration, we find:
Taking 78 and subtract it by 21 which gives us 57, and from this result subtracting 27 will eventually give us 72:
(78 - 21) - 27 = 57 - 27 = 30, this is still not the right path, so let's try another permutation:
Indeed, the best path appears to be using 78 - 27 = 51 and then applying (51 + 21) = 72.
So, the equation would be: 78 - 27 + 21 = 72.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 27 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 93, 5, and 99 to create an equation that equals 11. I should check the possible operations between these numbers.
If I subtract 93 from 99, I get 6. This is close to 11, but not quite there.
Next, I try subtracting 5 from 93, which gives 88. This is still far from 11.
I then consider combining 93 and 5. Subtracting 5 from 93 gives 88, again too high.
Now, looking at the combinations, I notice multiplying 5 and 93 gives 465, which doesn't help.
Then I spot the combination that could work: dividing 93 by 99 (a very small number) gives a result closer to 1 than any other operation.
Lastly, I realize that 93 divided by 99 is approximately 0. 939393..., and if I subtract 8 (which is 93 - 88), and then add 5 (since it's close but off a little), I get closer to 11.
So, (93 / 99) - 8 + 5 = 11.
However, upon re-examination, this complicated the solution. Instead, the simplest solution I can find is:
Using the numbers 5 and 99, I can add them and then subtract 93, which gives 11:
99 + 5 - 93 = 11.
</think>
<answer> 99 + 5 - 93 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 70, and 91 that equals 95. I'll start by looking at the numbers and considering how I can use arithmetic operations to reach 95.
First, let's see if adding or subtracting these numbers will get us close to 95.
74 + 70 = 144 (which is too high)
74 + 91 = 165 (also too high)
70 + 91 = 161 (still too high)
74 - 70 = 4 (too low)
74 - 91 = -17 (too low)
70 - 91 = -21 (also too low)
Now, let's try a different approach using multiplication and addition:
(91 - 70) * 1 = 21 (not 95)
(74 - 91) * 1 = -17 (not 95)
(74 - 70) * 91 = 4 * 91 = 364 (not 95)
It seems direct operations haven't worked, so let's try multiplication and addition together:
(91 - 70) + 74 = 21 + 74 = 95
This matches our target value of 95.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 70) + 74 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 23, 26, and 33 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 16. 
- First, let's try to use subtraction and addition:
  - If we subtract 23 from 26 and then add 33, we get:
    26 - 23 = 3
    3 + 33 = 36 (This isn't equal to 16)
  - Let's try another combination:
    - Subtract 23 from 33 and then add 26, we get:
      33 - 23 = 10
      10 + 26 = 36 (Still not 16)
  - We should also try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
    - Multiply 23 by 26 and then subtract 33, we get:
      23 * 26 = 598
      598 - 33 = 565 (This isn't 16 either)
  - One more try could be using the numbers as they are, but they don't add up to 16 directly.
  - Let's try another approach by reevaluating if we can combine operations differently:
    - 26 - 33 + 23, this fits perfectly:
      26 - 33 = -7
      -7 + 23 = 16
</think>
<answer> 26 - 33 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 70, 71, and 82 exactly once. 
Let's consider subtraction and addition. If we subtract 70 from 71, we get 1. We still need a number 80 more to reach 81, and 82 is available.
So, (71 - 70) + 82 = 1 + 82 = 83, which is too high.
Let's try another combo: (82 - 71) + 70 = 11 + 70 = 81.
This works as it uses each number only once.
</think>
<answer>(82 - 71) + 70</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 61, 89, and 8 to make 20. 
First, let's look at the numbers and their magnitudes. The numbers 61 and 89 are quite large, while 8 is small. 
Considering the operations, subtraction is a good candidate to reduce the difference between 89 and 61.
89 - 61 = 28
Now, we need to get from 28 to 20. We can do this by subtracting 8 from 28, because 8 is one of the given numbers.
So the equation is 89 - 61 - 8 = 20.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 61 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 20, 49, and 50 to make 79. One way to approach this is to consider if any of the numbers can be subtracted from the sum of the other two. 
First, I'll try to find the sum of any two numbers and then see if I can reach 79 by using the third number. Let's start with the sum of 50 and 49 which equals 99. If I subtract 20 from 99, I get 79. This gives us our equation: 99 - 20 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (50 + 49) - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 63, 37, and 43 exactly once to get 69 as the result. Let's try different combinations of the numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider the differences and sums between these numbers.
43 + 37 = 80
63 - 14 = 69
So if 43 + 37 = 80 and 63 - 14 = 69, then the operation must be 63 - (43 + 37 - 69)
Let's check this:
63 - (43 + 37 - 69)
= 63 - (80 - 69)
= 63 - 11
= 52
It's not quite 69. I need to consider the order of operations.
Instead, let's try the direct operation as follows:
63 - 43 + 37
= 20 + 37
= 57
That still doesn't give 69. 
Another possibility is to consider reverse operations:
43 - 37 + 63
= 6 + 63
= 69
This results in 69, which is correct.
</think>
<answer> 43 - 37 + 63 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 63, 37, and 43 that equals 69. I should explore combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with these numbers. 
If I look at the numbers, 63 + 37 = 100 and 100 - 43 = 57. This is close, but not quite 69. 
If I try 63 - 37 = 26, then 26 + 43 = 69. This gives me the right result.
So, the equation is 63 - 37 + 43 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 37 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 63, 37, and 43 exactly once to get a result of 69. Let's consider the operations and the numbers we have.
- Adding the numbers directly does not get us close to 69.
- Subtracting one number from another will not isolate us near 69 either.
- Multiplication gives us a result that is too large and division doesn't simplify solving the target number 69.
Looking closer at the numbers, 63 - 37 gives us 26. Now, if we add 43 to 26, we get 69.
So, the equation would be 63 - 37 + 43 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 37 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 68, 7, and 15 to make 76. 
First, let's see if any of the numbers are close to 76. Clearly, 68 is close, so I can use 68.
Now, I need to get from 68 to 76 using the remaining numbers 7 and 15.
Subtracting 7 from 68 gives me 61. 
Adding 15 to 61 gives me 76.
Therefore, the equation is 68 - 7 + 15 = 76. </think>
<answer> 68 - 7 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to arrange the given numbers (7, 20, 58, 10) using basic arithmetic operations to get 81. First, I'll look at the numbers and see which one can be the base or the starting point. The number 58 seems significant as it's relatively close to 81.
Let's try to use 58 as it's a strong base:
58 + 23 = 81
Now I need to form 23 using the remaining numbers 7, 20, and 10. One way is:
10 + 7 + 6 = 23
Since 6 isn't available, I need to re-evaluate. Another way could be using the reverse operations:
20 - 10 + 7 = 27
And then subtract a smaller number from 58:
58 - 27 = 31
This is still not 23, so let's try another permutation:
20 + 10 - 7 = 23
So, using all numbers at once:
58 + (20 + 10 - 7) = 58 + 23 = 81
</think>
<answer> 58 + (20 + 10 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 78, 19, and 10 that equals 69. Let's consider different combinations of operations.
First, let's see if we can get close to 69 using addition and subtraction with these numbers.
78 + 19 + 10 = 107 (too high)
78 + 19 - 10 = 87 (still too high)
78 + 10 - 19 = 79 (very close, let's try different combinations)
78 - 19 + 10 = 69 (this works!)
So, the correct equation is 78 - 19 + 10 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 19 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 5, 15, and 45 exactly once to get 25. 
One approach is to look at if any combination of these numbers, when combined with basic arithmetic operations, can yield 25. 
If I divide 45 by 15, I get 3. Then if I take 5 and subtract this result, I have 5 - 3 = 2. 
I still need to get to 25 from 25. This doesn't seem feasible. 
Let's try another approach: let's multiply 5 and 5 to get 25. That's a straightforward solution but we cannot reuse the 5, and we also must use the 15 and 45.
Next, let's try 45 - (15 / 5). 
If I divide 15 by 5, I get 3. 
Then if I subtract 3 from 45, I get 45 - 3 = 42, which is not 25 either.
Finally, let's try 45 - 15 - 5. 
If I subtract 15 from 45, I get 30. 
Then if I subtract 5 from 30, I get 30 - 5 = 25. This combination works.
So the equation is: 45 - 15 - 5 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 45 - 15 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 5, 15, and 45 exactly once to get 25. 
One approach is to consider how I can combine these numbers using arithmetic operations.
I notice that 45 can be broken down into 15 * 3.
So, if I subtract 15 from 45, I get 30, which is very close to 25.
Then, if I subtract 5 from 30, I get exactly 25.
Therefore, the equation is 45 - 15 - 5 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 45 - 15 - 5 </answer>

<think> To create an equation using the numbers 95, 7, and 67 that equals 21, I need to consider all possible combinations of the basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different orders:
1. 95 - 7 - 67 = 21 (This works! Let's check the other numbers to make sure 7 and 67 are used correctly.)
Calculating it: 95 - 7 = 88, then 88 - 67 = 21.
This solution uses all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 7) - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 94, 57, and 52 in some combination of basic arithmetic operations to get 15. 
First, I notice that 94 - 57 = 37, which is too large, and 94 - 52 = 42, which is also too large.
Next, I consider using 57 and 52. If I subtract 52 from 57, I get 5. 
Then, I have 5 and 37. Adding or subtracting these doesn't directly give me 15. 
The key is noticing that 37 - 5 = 32 is far from 15. 
Now, if I try other combinations, I see that using 37 - 52 + 94, I don't get to 15.  
However, if I consider 57 + 52 - 94, what I get is 109 - 94 = 15. This combination works.
So, the equation is 57 + 52 - 94 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 52 - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 71, 5, and 26 that equals 40, we need to experiment with different combinations of operations.
One possible way to achieve this is:
26 + 5 = 31
Then we need to get from 31 to 40 by using the remaining number 71.
Subtracting 31 from 71 gives us:
71 - 31 = 40
So the equation is:
71 - (26 + 5) = 40
</think>
<answer> 71 - (26 + 5) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 71, 5, and 26 that equals 40, I'll start by looking at the numbers and considering which operations could help me get close to 40.
71 + 5 = 76
76 - 26 = 50
Now, to get exactly 40, I need to reduce the result of 50 by 10. I can do this by subtracting 5 from 26:
26 - 5 = 21
So, I now have:
50 - 21 = 29, which is still not 40.
But, I can work with the other numbers to adjust this. 71 - 5 = 66. Now, I see that if I subtract 26 from 66, I get exactly 40:
66 - 26 = 40
This works, but remember I used 5 and 26 already. Let's check: 71 - 5 = 66, then 66 - 26 = 40. This gives us:
71 - 5 - 26 = 40
</think>
<answer>(71 - 5) - 26</answer>

<think> I need to use the numbers 98, 30, and 21 in a way that results in 89. Let's start by looking at what we can do with these numbers. 98 is the largest, so it's a good candidate to subtract or divide from. One useful operation is to try subtracting a smaller number from 98.
If I subtract 30 from 98, I get 68. Now, I need to reach 89 from 68. Adding 21 to 68 gives me 89, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is 98 - 30 + 21 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 30 + 21 </answer>

<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 27 using the numbers 60, 72, and 15. Looking at the numbers, 15 is the smallest and could be a potential candidate for a base. If I subtract 15 from 60, I get 45. Now, I need to reach 27 from 45. I could try dividing 45 by 2 to get 22.5, but that's not 27. However, if I take 72 and subtract 45, I get 27 exactly. Therefore, the equation using the numbers once is:
72 - (60 - 15) = 27
</think>
<answer> 72 - (60 - 15) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 60, 72, and 15 exactly once to make an equation that equals 27. Let's try to form a plausible equation:
1. One approach could be to use subtraction or division to reach a number close to 27.
2. If we divide 72 by 15, we get 4.8, which is pretty close to 5.
3. Then, if we subtract 5 from 60, we get 55 - 5 = 50, which is still far from 27.
4. Let's try manipulating the numbers differently: if we take 60 and subtract 72, we get -12, which is not what we want.
5. Now, if we think about 60 - 72 + 15, we would be doing 60 - 72 = -12 and then -12 + 15 = 3, which is still not 27.
6. Let's try 15 - 72 + 60, this would be 15 - 72 = -57 and then -57 + 60 = 3, which isn't 27 either.
7. The correct combination seems to be 60 - 72 + 15. However, this results in 3, which is not the target. 
8. Finally, using the equation 60 - 72 + 15, we get -12 + 15 = 3. To achieve 27, we need to consider adding parenthesis: (60 - 72) + 15. Here, 60 - 72 equals -12, and -12 + 15 equals 3.
9. Clearly, this doesn't get us 27. Let's consider a different approach: (60 + 15) - 72. Here, 60 + 15 equals 75, and 75 - 72 equals 3.
10. Still not 27, so we should try with a different premise. However, from the available numbers, the correct approach seems to be (60 + 15 - 72), which equals 15 - 72 = -57, and this isn't 27 either.
11. If we do (60 - 72 + 15), we end up with 3, not 27. Hence, the right path needs to be revisited.
12. Finally, if we work with (15 + 60) - 72 or more precisely, we find the solution lies in considering (72 - 60) + 15 = 12 + 15 = 27. This gives us the result we're looking for.
</think>
<answer> (72 - 60) + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 23, 51, and 64 to make an equation equal 92. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
- First, let's try adding 23 and 51: 23 + 51 = 74
- We need 18 more to reach 92. The difference between 74 and 92 is 18.
- Now, checking the remaining number, 64, we see that 74 + 64 = 138 or 23 + 64 = 87, which doesn't help solving the problem.
- Instead, let's try subtracting 64 from 51: 51 - 64 = -13, this is not helpful.
- Now let's try another approach: 64 - (51 - 23) = 64 - 28 = 36, still far from 92.
- Let's use 64 + (51 - 23) = 64 + 28 = 92, which is exactly what we need.
So 64 + (51 - 23) equals 92.
</think>
<answer> 64 + (51 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 49 using the numbers 76, 10, 28, and 45 exactly once. Let's try combining them in different ways.
One approach could be to use subtraction and addition:
1. Start with 76 - 28 = 48
2. Now we need 1 more to reach 49, so we can add 10 + 45 = 55, but that's too much.
3. Instead, let's try: 76 - 28 - 45 + 10 = 43
This is not 49, so let's try another combination:
4. What if we try the reverse order and use 76 - 28 + 45 - 10?
5. 76 - 28 = 48
6. 48 + 45 = 93
7. 93 - 10 = 83
This is still not 49, so let's use a different calculation:
8. Now trying: 76 + 28 - 45 + 10
9. 76 + 28 = 104
10. 104 - 45 = 59
11. 59 + 10 = 69
This also doesn't work. Let's reconsider:
12. Trying: 76 + 28 - 45 - 10
13. 76 + 28 = 104
14. 104 - 45 = 59
15. 59 - 10 = 49
Therefore, the correct equation is 76 + 28 - 45 - 10 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 76 + 28 - 45 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 64, 56, 37, and 63 to get 34. Let's start by looking at the numbers and considering possible combinations. One way to approach this is to see if any straightforward combination using addition or subtraction can work.
64 + 56 = 120
This is too high, so we can't use addition. Let's try subtraction:
64 - 56 = 8
Now our list is 8, 37, 63. We need to make 34, so let's try:
63 - 37 = 26
This still doesn't give us 34. Now, if we rearrange and look at multiplication or division, we can explore:
37 * 8 = 296
That's way too high. Let's try a combination that includes division:
56 / 8 = 7
Now our numbers are 8, 37, 63, 7. Now we see:
63 - 37 = 26
And then:
26 - 7 = 19
This is not 34, so that's not the solution. Let's try another approach:
56 - 37 = 19
And then:
63 - 19 = 44
Still not 34. On a final attempt, let's simplify:
64 - 37 = 27
56 - 63 = -7
-7 + 27 = 20
We still need 14 more to get 34, so another approach. Let's use another subtraction directly:
64 - 63 = 1
56 - 37 = 19
19 - 1 = 18
We're close now, and subtracting 4 from 18 gives us 14:
64 - 56 = 8
63 - 8 = 55
55 - 18 = 37
And finally:
55 - 37 = 18
We realize this method isn't working either. Let's simplify using addition and subtraction:
64 - 56 = 8
8 + (63 - 37) = 8 + 26 = 34
This works! Therefore, the equation is 64 - 56 + (63 - 37) = 34.
</think>
<answer> 64 - 56 + (63 - 37) </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 39 using the numbers 70, 25, 23, and 61, one possible combination is:
70 - 25 - 23 + 61
First, I'll perform the minus operations:
70 - 25 = 45
Then, subtracting 23 from 45:
45 - 23 = 22
Finally, adding 61 to 22:
22 + 61 = 83
This is not the target number, so let's try another combination.
Let's try another operation:
70 - 25 + 23 - 61
First, we'll perform 70 - 25:
70 - 25 = 45
Then, adding 23:
45 + 23 = 68
Finally, subtracting 61:
68 - 61 = 7
This is still not 39, so we need to rearrange the operations.
Let's try:
25 - 61 + 70 - 23
First, we'll perform 25 - 61:
25 - 61 = -36
Then, we'll add 70:
-36 + 70 = 34
Finally, subtract 23:
34 - 23 = 11
This is not 39 either. We need to re-evaluate the operations.
Another try might be:
25 + 70 - 61 - 23
First, we'll perform 25 + 70:
25 + 70 = 95
Then, subtracting 61:
95 - 61 = 34
Finally, subtracting 23:
34 - 23 = 11
This doesn't work either, so let's use different combinations.
Let's try:
(70 - 25) + (23 + 61)
First, we'll perform 70 - 25:
70 - 25 = 45
Then, we'll perform 23 + 61:
23 + 61 = 84
Finally, adding these results:
45 + 84 = 129
This is not 39.
Reevaluating again:
(70 + 25) - (61 - 23)
First, we'll perform 70 + 25:
70 + 25 = 95
Then, we'll perform 61 - 23:
61 - 23 = 38
Finally, subtracting these results:
95 - 38 = 57
This is not 39.
Trying (25 + 70) * (61 - 23)
First, we'll perform 25 + 70:
25 + 70 = 95
Then, we'll perform 61 - 23:
61 - 23 = 38
Then we multiply:
95 * 38 = 3, 610
This is not 39.
Let's now try the correct combination:
25 + 70 - 61 + 23
First, we'll perform 25 + 70:
25 + 70 = 95
Then, we'll perform 61 - 23:
61 - 23 = 38
Finally, we add these results:
95 + 38 = 133
This is not 39.
This combination also doesn't give 39.
Finally,
(25 + 61) - (70 - 23)
First, perform 25 + 61:
25 + 61 = 86
Then perform 70 - 23:
70 - 23 = 47
Finally, subtract it:
86 - 47 = 39
</think>
<answer> (25 + 61) - (70 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 51 using the numbers 92, 81, 44, and 84 exactly once, we need to carefully consider the operations we can use.
First, let's see if we can get close to 51 with simple operations. If we subtract 44 from 92, we get 48. Now we need to get from 48 to 51 by using the remaining numbers 81 and 84.
Adding 81 to 48 gives us 129, which is too high. Subtracting 84 from 48 gives us -36, which is also not what we want.
Therefore, let's try multiplication and division. We know that:
81 * 6 = 486, which is significantly high.
44 * 12 = 528, which is far too high.
However, let's try 84 / 1.8 = 46.67, which is close to 48 and then adding 3 would get us to 51 using 81. But 84 / 1.8 is not an integer, so we need another approach.
Let's try another combination: 84 - 44 = 40. Now we need 11 from 92 and 81.
92 - 81 = 11. Adding 40 (92 - 44) to 11 gives us 51.
So, the equation is: (92 - 44) + (84 - 81) = 51.
</think>
<answer>(92 - 44) + (84 - 81)</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 87 using the numbers 77, 28, and 38 exactly once, we need to consider all possible combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's look at the numbers we have:
- 77
- 28
- 38
We see that 87 is somewhat close to 77, so let's try to use 77 and 28 with some arithmetic operation to get close to 87. If we subtract 28 from 77, we get 49. Then we need 38 more to reach 87. We can achieve this by adding 38. So the equation would be:
77 - 28 + 38 = 87
</think>
<answer> 77 - 28 + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 53, 11, 38, and 25 exactly once to reach the result of 51. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One way to approach this is to consider subtraction and division. 
53 - 38 = 15
15 - 11 = 4
4 - 25 = -21 (too negative)
This doesn't help. Let's try another approach:
53 - 38 = 15
15 - 25 = -10
11 + 10 = 21 (too much)
Another try:
53 - 38 = 15
15 + 25 = 40 (too much)
Another approach:
38 + 11 = 49
53 - 49 = 4
4 + 25 = 29 (too much)
One more attempt:
53 + 11 = 64
64 - 38 = 26
26 - 25 = 1 (too small)
Another:
25 + 11 = 36
53 - 36 = 17
17 + 25 = 42 (too much)
Finally, trying specific operations:
53 - (38 + 11) = 53 - 49 = 4
25 - 4 = 21 (too much)
A combination still needed:
53 + (25 - 38) = 53 + 7 = 60 (too much)
Then simplifying did not work:
11 + (53 - 38) = 11 + 15 = 26
25 - 26 = -1 (too negative)
Revising:
53 - (38 + 25 - 11) = -5
Then checking:
(53 + 11 + 25) - 38 = (53 + 36) - 38 = 89 - 38 = 51
Thus, the correct equation is: (53 + 11 + 25) - 38 = 51.
</think>
<answer> (53 + 11 + 25) - 38 </answer>

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 34, 12, and 53 that equals 75. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
First, we see if any direct operations with these numbers will yield 75 immediately.
34 + 12 + 53 = 99 (too high)
34 + 53 - 12 = 75 (this seems to be the right approach)
Thus, the equation using these numbers that equals 75 is 34 + 53 - 12.

<answer> 34 + 53 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 78, 88 that equals 11. I can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with these numbers.
- First, I notice that 88 - 78 = 10, which is close but not exactly 11.
- If I try to adjust this, one idea is to add 1. But adding 1 to 10 doesn't make 11.
- However, if I use the number 1 directly, I can add and subtract it in a way that achieves the target result.
- I can start with 88 - 78 = 10.
- Then subtract 1 from 10 to get 9.
- Finally, subtract another 1 to get 8 - 1 = 7, but I want to get 11, so let's adjust.
- A better approach could be: (88 - 78) + 1 = 11.
</think>
<answer>(88 - 78) + 1</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 55, 98, and 7 to make 50. 
Considering 98 is quite high, subtracting it from 55 or 7 won't get me close. 
55 - 98 is negative (-43), and 55 - 7 is 48, which is still too far from 50.
98 - 55 = 43, and 50 - 43 = 7, which is one of the numbers we have.
This suggests we should use 55 - 98 + 7 = -43 + 7 = -36, which is not 50.
Using 98 - 55 = 43 and adding one number (7) to get 50, isn't working.
Consider another combination, 98 - 55 = 43, then find the number that, when added to 7, gives 50.
7 + 43 = 50, so we need 98 - 55 + 7 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 55 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 90, 60, and 19 that equals 49, I need to consider how different operations can manipulate these numbers.
First, I see that 90 - 60 = 30, which is close to 49. Then, 30 + 19 = 49, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is: 90 - 60 + 19 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 60) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 90, 60, and 19 exactly once to form an equation that equals 49. Let's start by considering the operations we might use:
- Multiplication or division might help us get closer to 49, but 19 doesn't have many good divisors.
- Addition and subtraction might be necessary to adjust up or down to get to 49.
Let's try combining 60 and 19:
60 + 19 = 79
Now we need to get from 79 to 49, so we need to subtract 30 (79 - 30 = 49).
To get 30 from the remaining 90, we can do:
90 - 60 = 30
So putting it all together:
(90 - 60) + 19 = 30 + 19 = 49
</think>
<answer> (90 - 60) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 67, 4, 43, and 60 to make 88. Let's try combining the numbers and operations.
- First, I notice that 67 - 43 = 24, which brings us closer to 88.
- Adding 60 to the result gives us 60 + 24 = 84, which is still not 88.
- We need 4 more to reach 88, and 4 is a small number that could be added in.
Combining these insights, I can put it together as: 67 - 43 + 60 + 4 = 88.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 43 + 60 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 90, 44, and 97 to make 51. Let's start by calculating the sum and difference of the numbers to see if we can get 51.
97 + 44 = 141 (too high)
97 - 44 = 53 (too high)
90 + 44 = 134 (too high)
90 + 97 = 187 (too high)
90 - 44 = 46 (getting closer, but negative 51)
Now let's consider the reverse operations:
97 - 90 = 7 (too small)
And then we have the intermediate result 46 - 7 = 39 (too small). This combination doesn't work yet.
Let's try a combination that might work:
97 - 44 = 53 - 2 (but 2 isn't in the set)
Then, we can consider:
97 - (90 + 44) = 97 - 134 which is -37 (too far)
Now let's see if we can use the reverse order:
97 - 90 = 7, then 51 - 7 = 44 (can't use 44)
Another attempt:
97 - 90 = 7, then 44 + 7 = 51. But we can't use 44 twice.
Finally, let's consider:
97 - 90 + 44 = 7 + 44 = 51
This works.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 90 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 94, 44, and 75 that equals 25. Let's evaluate the possibilities:
- First, I'll check if the numbers can be manipulated to get close to 25. Adding or subtracting them doesn't seem to work as they are very large.
- Then, I'll consider multiplication and division. If I divide 94 by 75, I get 1.2533, which is too small.
- Dividing 94 by 44 gives approximately 2.1364, which is also too small.
- Now, let's consider multiplication and addition/subtraction: (94 - 75) * 44 = 89, which is still far away.
- Let's try another approach: taking the difference between 94 and 75 is 19, and then applying the operation to 44: 94 - 75 = 19 and 19 * 44 = 844, which is too large.
- Finally, let's try 94 - (75 * 44/100) = 94 - 33 = 61, which is not applicable here.
After considering all these steps, it seems none of these operations directly give 25. However, there is another possibility that didn't cross my mind initially.
- Checking again, I realize: if we calculate 94 - (75 + 44), we get 94 - 119 = -25. This equation does not equal 25 but -25.
- The correct equation and solution should be using 75 - (94 - 44) = 75 - 50 = 25.
So, the correct equation is: 75 - (94 - 44) = 25.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (94 - 44) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 25 using the numbers 94, 44, and 75 exactly once. We can try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
Let's start by looking at the numbers we have:
- 94
- 44
- 75
If we consider addition and subtraction, it seems challenging to reach 25 using these numbers. Let's try multiplication and division.
If we take 75 × 44, we get a big number which is not 25. Similarly, any other combination of division with these numbers won't yield 25.
Let's try another approach by looking at the difference between 94 and 75, which is 19, and see if we can use that with the other number to make 25:
94 - 75 = 19
Now we need 16 more to make 25:
19 - 44 = -25 (which is not correct)
But, if we look at the problem from another perspective, we can use 75 + 44 to get 119, and then consider 119 - 94:
75 + 44 = 119
119 - 94 = 25
This works as 25 is the result we are looking for.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 44 - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 55, 58, and 66 to work with, and we need to form an equation that equals 63 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this could be to subtract one number from another and then add or subtract another number.
If we subtract 55 from 66, we get 11.
Then if we add 58 to 11, we get 69.
This is close but not exactly 63. Let's try a different combination.
Another possibility is to subtract 58 from 66, which gives 8, and then add 55 to it.
So 66 - 58 + 55 = 8 + 55 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 58 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 11, and 24 to get 47. One way to approach this is to look at the operations we might need. Since 24 is quite close to 47, we can consider subtracting 24 from 47 and see what remains. That would be 47 - 24 = 23. Now we need 23 using 12 and 11. By adding 12 and 11, we get 23. So the equation will be: 24 + 12 + 11 = 47.
</think>
<answer> 24 + 12 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 48, 31, and 68 using basic arithmetic operations to reach 85. 
First, I will consider if any direct operation can give me close to 85. Adding 48 and 31 gives 79, which is close but slightly too low. Adding 48 and 68 gives 116, which is too high. 
Next, I will consider multiplication and subtraction. If we subtract 31 from 48, we get 17. If we then add this to 68, we get 85. 
So, the calculation is: 48 - 31 + 68 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 48 - 31 + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 85 using the numbers 48, 31, and 68 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
First, we see that 68 is the largest number, and if we subtract it from 85, we get 17 (85 - 68 = 17).
Next, we see that 48 is close to 17, and if we subtract 48 from 31, we get -17 (31 - 48 = -17).
So, the equation becomes 68 + (-17) which equals 51. This is not 85.
Now, let's try another combination: 85 - 68 = 17, and if we add 48 to 31, we get 79 (48 + 31 = 79).
This is not 85 either.
Finally, let's try this: (68 - 31) + 48 = 85.
This gives us 37 + 48 = 85, which is correct.
So the final equation is (68 - 31) + 48 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (68 - 31) + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 5, 24, and 98 which equals 79. One way to approach this is to consider if any combination of basic arithmetic operations can lead to the desired result.
Looking at the numbers, we can try to add or subtract them in different ways, or use multiplication and division. 
If we use 98 - 24 = 74, we are very close to 79. We just need 5 more to reach 79. If we take 74 - 5, we get 69, which isn't 79.
But if we try 98 - 24 + 5, we get 79. This seems to work. </think>
<answer> 98 - 24 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 79 using the numbers 5, 24, and 98 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider how these numbers might combine.
One useful approach is to look for an operation that can make the larger numbers like 98 closer to 79. Notice that 98 - 24 = 74, which is very close to 79. Therefore, we need to add 5 to 74 to get 79.
Thus, the equation would be: 98 - 24 + 5 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 24) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 9, 60, 33, and 94 to make 76. Let's try combining the numbers with basic operations.
If we look at 60 - 33 = 27, we have a value of 27 from the operation.
Next, we know 76 - 27 = 49, but we don't have the number 49 directly.
However, 94 - 60 = 34, which when combined with 9, can help us reach 76.
Considering (94 - 60) + 9 = 34 + 9 = 43.
Finally, 76 - 43 = 33, we need to add 33 to reach 76.
So, we can use: 94 - 60 + 9 = 43 and 43 + 33 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 60 + 9) + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 57, 4, and 4 to make 41. We can try combining different operations.
- First, let's see if we can use subtraction or addition to get close to 41 with the numbers we have.
- If I use 57 - 4, I get 53, which is too high.
- If I use 57 - 4 - 4, I get 49, still too high.
- If I use 57 - 4 + 4, I get 57, which is high too.
- Now, let's try 57 / 4 + 4:
  - 57 / 4 equals 14.25 (approximately), and then adding 4 to this gives us 18.25, which is far from 41.
- Let's try reversing the order: 57 + 4 - 4:
  - 57 + 4 equals 61, and then subtracting 4 gives us 57.
- Let's try reversing it again: 4 * 4 + 57:
  - 4 * 4 equals 16, and then adding 57 gives us 73, which is too high.
- Finally, let's try 57 - 4 * 4:
  - 4 * 4 equals 16, and then subtracting 16 from 57 gives us 41.
This last attempt results in the exact number we need.
</think>
<answer> 57 - 4 * 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 70 using the numbers 47, 77, and 54 exactly once. The equation should use basic arithmetic operations.
I can start by looking at the target number and the available numbers. 70 can be reached by combining 47 and 23, but 23 is not available. 
Next, I notice that 77 - 54 is 23, which is half of 47. So if we can use this 23 somewhere in the equation, we can reach 70.
Therefore, the equation would be: (77 - 54) + 47 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 54) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 47, 77, and 54 once each to make 70. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's see if we can get close to 70 by adding or subtracting the numbers.
47 + 77 = 124 (too high)
77 + 54 = 131 (too high)
47 + 54 = 101 (too high)
77 - 47 = 30 (not enough)
47 - 54 = -7 (not enough)
Now let's try combinations with multiplication or division:
47 * 1. 54 = 73. 98 (not close enough)
77 * (54 / 100) = 41. 28 (not enough)
After trying different combinations, it seems the numbers need to be rearranged in a specific order using the operations:
54 - 47 = 7
77 - 7 = 70
So we have 54 - 47 = 7, then 77 - 7 = 70.
</think>
<answer> 77 - (54 - 47) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 90, 92, and 91 that equals 89. Each number can only be used once and basic arithmetic operations are allowed.
First, let's consider the difference between 92 and 91 which gives us 1. Now, if we subtract this result from 90, we get:
90 - 1 = 89
So, the equation combining 90, 92, and 91 to get 89 is 90 - (92 - 91).
</think>
<answer> 90 - (92 - 91) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation that equals 49 using the numbers 12, 34, 76, and 19. Let's test different combinations of the operations and operands.
First, let's consider if any of these numbers can be subtracted from or added to another to get close to 49.
- If we subtract 19 from 76, we get 57. This is too high.
- Adding 12 and 34 gives us 46, which is still too low.
- If we consider multiplication and division, 76 * 12 = 912, which is much too high.
Considering these combinations, let's try 76 - 19 + 12 + 34.
- Start with 76 - 19 = 57 
- Then add 12: 57 + 12 = 69
- Finally add 34: 69 + 34 = 103, which is also too high.
Now, let's try a different combination: (76 - 34) + 19 + 12.
- (76 - 34) = 42
- 42 + 19 = 61
- 61 + 12 = 73, which is still too high.
Now let's try: (34 + 19) - 12 + 76.
- (34 + 19) = 53
- 53 - 12 = 41
- 41 + 76 = 117, which is too high.
Now there is a better approach: (76 - 34) + 19 = 41 + 12.
- (76 - 34) = 42
- 42 + 12 = 54, which is still too high.
The combination (34 + 19) + (76 - 12) seems promising.
- (34 + 19) = 53
- (76 - 12) = 64
- 53 + 64 = 117, which is too high.
Finally, let's use another combination: 76 + 19 - 12 - 34.
- 76 + 19 = 95
- 95 - 12 = 83
- 83 - 34 = 49, which is correct.
This means the final equation is 76 + 19 - 12 - 34 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 76 + 19 - 12 - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 49 using the numbers 12, 34, 76, and 19 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. 
First, let's look at the numbers and consider their relationships. Adding or subtracting these numbers does not seem promising for reaching 49. 
Considering multiplication and division:
- Multiplying 19 by 2 gives 38, which is close to 49 but not quite there.
- Multiplying 19 by 3 gives 57, which is too large.
- Multiplying 19 by 2.5 would give 47.5, which is not an integer.
- Dividing 76 by 2 gives 38, which is close again but we need 11 more to reach 49.
- Adding 12 to 34 gives 46, which is still short by 3.
- If we consider 34 and 76, we can see that 76 - 34 = 42, then add 19 to that: 42 + 19 = 61, which is still too large.
- If we take 76 - 34 = 42 and then subtract 12 to go below 49 gives 42 - 12 = 30, and then add 19 to reach 49: 30 + 19 = 49.
So, the equation that works is 76 - 34 - 12 + 19 = 49. </think>
<answer> 76 - 34 - 12 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 33, 61, and 4 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I can start by looking at the numbers and considering what combinations might add up to 98.
The sum of 61 and 33 is 94, which is very close to 98. If I can get 4 more, I will have my solution.
If I subtract 4 from 61, I get 57. But I need 4 more to reach 98, so I need to find 4 somewhere else. The only number I have left is 4, and subtracting 4 from 4 gives me -4, which doesn't work.
Instead, if I take 4 away from 33, I get 29, and then adding 61 to 29 gives me 90. Now I just need to add 8 to 90 to get to 98.
So I need 8, and I see that 61 - 53 would give me 8, but 53 is not one of my numbers. If I add 33 and 4, I get 37, and then 61 - 37 equals 24, which is not 8.
Given the numbers, another way is 61 - 33 = 28, then 28 * 4 = 112 which is too high. This means 61 + 33 = 94, and we need 4 more.
Adding 4 to 94 gives us 98.
So, the correct equation should be (61 + 33) + 4 = 98.
</think>
<answer>(61 + 33) + 4</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 95, 25, and 89 that equals 31, I need to consider the possible arithmetic operations and how they can manipulate these numbers.
I notice 89 - 25 = 64, which is quite close to 31. If I could make this value smaller, it could be closer. Notice that 64 - 95 = -31, which is exactly what we need.
Therefore, the equation is: 89 - 25 - 95 = -31.
However, the equation needs to equal 31, not -31. The negative sign just reverses the value, so I can simply add 62 (which is 31 * -2) to the equation to make it equal 31. But we need to use only the numbers provided. Let's try reconfiguring it.
The correct approach is:
95 - 89 = 6
Then add 25 to it, we get:
95 - 89 + 25 = 31
</think>
<answer> 95 - 89 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 61, 3, and 28 to make 99. One way to do this is to consider the difference between 61 and 28 and then manipulate that result with 3.
The difference between 61 and 28 is 33.
Now, 61 - 28 = 33.
To reach 99, I need to multiply 33 by 3 (because 33 * 3 = 99).
Thus, the equation will be (61 - 28) * 3 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (61 - 28) * 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need an equation that equals 94 using the numbers 80, 27, and 13 exactly once. One approach could be to consider if there's a combination of operations that produce this result.
- If we look at the numbers closely, 80 and 13 are closer to making 94 without an additional number.
- We can try to use 80 - 13 to get 67, and then adding 27 to it should give us 94.
- So the equation becomes: 80 - 13 + 27 = 94.
This aligns with the required solution where every number is used once and the operations are basic arithmetic.</think>
<answer> 80 - 13 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 64, 98, and 78 that equals 84. Each number can only be used once.
Let's consider the operations:
64 + 98 = 162 (This is too high)
64 + 78 = 142 (Still too high)
98 + 78 = 176 (Too high)
64 - 78 = -14 (Not helpful for 84)
98 - 78 = 20 (Not bringing us close to 84)
What if we rearrange the parts:
98 - 78 = 20
Now we need 64 to make 84. We can try:
98 - 78 + 64 = 84
Here we have used the numbers exactly once and we have the correct result.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 78 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 64, 98, and 78 using basic arithmetic operations to get 84. I can start by looking at the differences and sums between these numbers.
98 - 78 = 20
64 + 20 = 84
This means we can use 64 + (98 - 78) = 84.
</think>
<answer> 64 + (98 - 78) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 96 using the numbers 31, 27, and 38, we need to consider different combinations of operations. We start by looking at the numbers to see if any simple operations can immediately give us 96 or a number close to it.
Let's try combining 38 and 27 first: 
38 + 27 = 65
This is not 96, but it's close. Now we need an additional 31 to reach 96:
65 + 31 = 96
So the equation using the numbers 38, 27, and 31 that results in 96 is 38 + 27 + 31 = 96.
</think>
<answer> 38 + 27 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 89 using the numbers 58, 33, 53, and 51 exactly once, I'll start by considering if any of the numbers can be combined to get close to 89.
58 + 33 = 91, which is close to 89. Now, we need to get 2 less to reach 89. We can get 2 by subtracting 51 + 33 = 84 and then adding 51 - 53 = -2. However, we can't use subtraction in this case as we need positive additions. Instead, I'll try 53 + 33 = 86 and then need 3 more to reach 89. We can achieve this by using 51 - 53 = -2, but applying the calculation correctly.
58 + 33 = 91 - 2 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 58 + 33 - (53 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> To get an equation that equals 85 using the numbers 4, 57, and 24 exactly once, with each number used only once and basic arithmetic operations, I should consider how the numbers interact with each other.
Starting with the numbers provided:
- 57 is close to 85 when subtracted from another number.
- 24 can be added or subtracted to or from a number to get closer to 85.
- 4 is relatively small and can be added or subtracted to reach 85.
Considering that 57 is the largest number, subtracting it from 85 would be the logical first step:
85 - 57 = 28
Now, 28 is just short of 24+4. We need to add 4 and 24 to get 28. However, since 4 is left and we've already used subtraction to get to 28, we can directly see:
28 + 4 = 32
And then:
32 + 24 = 56 which is not 85.
Therefore, another approach is:
57 - 24 = 33
Now needing to get from 33 to 85:
85 - 33 = 52
but 52 is not directly obtainable from 4. We need to add 4 to 52:
52 + 4 = 56 (but we need it to be 85)
The combination of using the remaining basic operations and maintaining the use of each number once doesn't fit directly.
So reviewing:
4 + (57 - 24) = 4 + 33 = 37 (not 85)
4 + (57 + 24) = 4 + 81 = 85 (fits our criteria)
Thus, the equation is:
4 + (57 + 24) = 85.
</think>
<answer> 4 + (57 + 24) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 22, 24, and 1 to get 47. Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- First, 24 + 22 = 46, which is close to 47.
- If I add 1 to 46, I get 47 exactly.
Thus, the equation would be 24 + 22 + 1.
</think>
<answer> 24 + 22 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 52, 87, and 41 that equals 98. Let's try different combinations using basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's check if we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide these numbers to get 98.
- Adding the numbers: 52 + 87 + 41 = 180 (too high)
- Subtracting the numbers: It's hard to get 98 with subtraction, especially as 41 is relatively small.
- Multiplying the numbers: 52 * 87 * 41 = 190,332 (way too high)
- Now, let's try dividing:
  - If we divide 87 by 41, we get 2.112195 (not an integer, so no good)
  - Let's try 52 / 41, which is 1.268293 (also not an integer)
  - Or, if we divide 52 by 2, we get 26, and then 87 - 26 = 61, which is still not 98
  - Now, 87 - 41 = 46, and then trying 52 - 46 = 6 (still not 98)
  - So, let's reconsider 52 + (87 - 41) = 52 + 46 = 98
 </think>
<answer> 52 + (87 - 41) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 25 using the numbers 74, 73, and 24 only once. Let's try to use subtraction and addition:
1. Start by looking at the numbers: 74 and 73 are very close to 146 and 144 which are close to 250, but not directly useful.
2. Consider using the difference between 74 and 73, which is 1 and then adding it to 24. 74 - 73 + 24 = 1 + 24 = 25.
Here, the equation is simply 74 - 73 + 24 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 73 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> To get from 44, 64, and 73 to 53 using basic arithmetic operations, I'll start by looking at which numbers might be useful to remove or add. Subtracting 73 from 64 gives -9, which isn't helpful. So let's try other combinations.
Adding 44 to 64 gives 108, also not helpful. 
Multiplying 73 by 64 actually gives a very large number and subtracting 44 doesn't bring us close to 53.
The only realistic opportunity to reach 53 comes from removing a number entirely, so let's consider what happens if we exclude 44.
That leaves us with 73 and 64. If we subtract 73 from 64 we get -9, which is still not 53.
Another idea is to divide 73 by 64, which doesn't work as it's not an integer.
Given the constraints, the only remaining possibility is to try to manipulate these numbers using another approach. Subtraction of 64 from 73 might give us 7, and using arithmetic on that to reach 53 could be interesting.
Subtracting 64 from 73 results in 9. Then if we take 9 - 4 (which remains 4 from the excluded number), we get 5. Then adding 4 leaves us with 53.
However, this isn't a direct path, thus I'll put it back to basic calculation which shows a direct manipulation simpler solution: 73 - 64 + 44 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 64 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 73, 64, and 44 that equals 53, I need to consider combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. One approach is to subtract the largest number from the sum of the other two.
Let's try: (73 + 64) - 44 = 137 - 44 = 93. This is too high.
Next, let's try: 73 - (64 + 44) = 73 - 108 = -35. This is too low.
Now, let's try: (73 + 44) - 64 = 117 - 64 = 53. This matches our target.
So, the equation is (73 + 44) - 64 = 53.
</think>
<answer>(73 + 44) - 64</answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 20, and 22 that equals 45. 
One way to approach this is to look for combinations of these numbers that could easily sum up to or come close to 45.
If we consider 22 + 20, we get 42. We need an additional 3 to reach 45.
So, the equation will be 22 + 20 + 3 which equals 45.
</think>
<answer> 22 + 20 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 25, 78, and 24 exactly once to get 29. 
First, let's consider the operations we can use. We can see that 25 - 24 = 1.
Then we need to add 28 more to reach 29. 
However, 78 - 25 = 53, which is close but doesn't give us exactly 28 when combined with 1.
Instead, let's consider the possibility of multiplication or division:
25 * 1. 12667 is not possible since we can't use fractions for this purpose.
78 / 24 = 3. 25 which also doesn't work.
78 + 25 + 24 is 127 which is too large.
Lastly, let's try: 78 - (25 + 24).
If we do that, we get 78 - 49 = 29.
Therefore, the equation is 78 - (25 + 24).
</think>
<answer> 78 - (25 + 24) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 20, 12, 93, and 40 exactly once to get 21. Let's consider using subtraction and addition together.
If I subtract 12 from 40, I get 28.
Now if I subtract 93 from 28, I get -65, which is not 21.
Instead, if I use the numbers this way: 93 - 20 - 12 = 51.
Now, if I subtract 51 from 40, I get -11, which still doesn't work.
Let's try a different combination: 93 - 40 = 53.
Now, I need to get from 21 to 53, so I use the remaining numbers 20 and 12. I can achieve this with 20 + 12 = 32.
So, to get from 21 to 53, I subtract 32 from 53, hence 53 - 32.
Finally, putting it all together: (93 - 40) - (20 + 12) = 53 - 32 = 21.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 40) - (20 + 12) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 99, 8, and 10 that equals 81. Let's try combining them in different ways.
If I divide 99 by 10, I get 9.9, which is close to 10 but not exact.
If I add 8 to 99, I get 107, which is too high.
If I subtract 8 from 99, I get 91, which is also too high.
If I consider multiplication or division of 8 and 10 with 99, 8 * 10 / 99 is not an integer and not close to 81.
The only viable option left is to use the subtraction first: 99 - (10 * 8). This calculation works as 10 * 8 is 80, and then subtracting 80 from 99 gives 19. This is not 81.
We need to re-arrange. Since 99 - 10 = 89 and 89 - 8 = 81 matches our target. This would be: 99 - 10 - 8 = 81.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 10 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 9, 57, and 16 once each to get 82. Let's start by seeing if any combination of these numbers using basic operations can give us 82.
First, let's try adding the largest two numbers and then adding or subtracting the smallest:
57 + 16 = 73
Now we have 9 left and we need to reach 82. If we add 9 to 73, we get 82.
So the equation would be: 57 + 16 + 9 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 16 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 13, 65, and 31 exactly once to get 83. First, I should consider if there's an operation that can make a significant difference. Adding 65 and 31 gives 96, which is close but too high. Subtracting 31 from 65 gives 34. Now, if I add 13 to 34, I get 47, which is still not 83. However, subtracting 47 from 65 gives 18, and adding 13 to 18 does give 83. So, the equation would be 65 - 13 + 31 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 13 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 4, 33, and 45 exactly once to get 82. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider if we can get close to 82 by adding and subtracting:
4 + 33 = 37 (Not close enough)
33 + 45 = 78 (Still not 82)
Then, we'll try multiplication and addition:
33 * 45 = 1485 (Too large)
33 * 4 = 132 (Too large)
Next, let's try different combinations with subtraction:
45 - 33 = 12
12 + 4 = 16 (Not 82)
Now, let's try different combinations:
(45 - 33) * 4 = 12 * 4 = 48 (Not 82)
(33 - 45) * 4 = -12 * 4 = -48 (Not 82)
Another try:
45 + 33 = 78
78 + 4 = 82
This seems promising. So the equation would be 45 + 33 + 4.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 33 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 74, 54, and 97 to get 31. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Multiplying and dividing doesn't seem to easily get us to 31, so let's try addition and subtraction.
- If I add 54 and 97, I get 151. Then if I subtract 151 from 74, I get -77, which is not 31.
- If I subtract 97 from 74, I get -23, and adding 54 to -23 gives 31. This looks promising.
So, the equation would be 74 - 97 + 54 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 97 + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 71, 20, and 57 exactly once, I need to consider the operations and the values they can produce.
- First, note that 71 is quite large, and 57 is close to 60 but less, making subtraction or addition involving these numbers not likely to result in 34.
- 20 is the smallest number and could be useful for smaller adjustments. 
If we try 71 - 57:
This gives us 14, far from the desired 34.
Next, consider the equation as:
71 - 57 + 20
We get: 14 + 20 = 34
This works. So the equation is 71 - 57 + 20 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 57 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 21, 42, and 59 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's look at the numbers: 
- 59 is quite large and 21 is small. 
- 42 seems to be a good candidate to use because it's close to 38.
We can start by subtracting 21 from 42, which would give us 21. Then we need to get from 21 to 18 to get to 38 if we add 21 to 18.
So, we would need to use 59 - 42 = 17, and then take 21 - 17 = 4, but that doesn't help us get 38.
Instead, let's try subtracting 42 from 59 which gives us 17. Then we need to take 21 - 17 = 4. This still doesn't get us to 38.
To achieve 38, we need to adjust the equation. We can try 42 - (21 - 59) / 2. 
Calculating the expression inside the parentheses, we get 28, and then subtracting 28 from 42 gives us 14. This is close but not 38.
Another approach is 59 - (42 - 21), which simplifies to 59 - 21, giving us 38.
This fulfills the requirement of using each number exactly once and the equation equals 38.
</think>
<answer> 59 - (42 - 21) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 21, 42, and 59 using basic arithmetic operations to get 38. Let's consider the numbers and possible operations.
- If we subtract 21 from 42, we get 21 (21 - 42 + 59 = 38).
- So the equation seems to be: (42 - 21) + 59 = 38.
Let's check if this is correct:
- 42 - 21 = 21.
- 21 + 59 = 80, which is not 38.
It seems combining those numbers and operations doesn't work out.
- Let's re-check by putting numbers in reverse operations.
- If we take 59 - 42 = 17, then adding 21 to this gives us: (59 - 42) + 21 = 38.
- Let's verify this equation:
  - 59 - 42 = 17.
  - 17 + 21 = 38.
The equation holds true. Therefore, the correct equation is (59 - 42) + 21 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (59 - 42) + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 14, 32, and 3 to get 49. One way to approach this is to consider if the numbers can be combined in a way that involves addition or subtraction.
- Let's try combining 14 and 32: 14 + 32 = 46, which is close to 49.
- To get from 46 to 49, we need to add 3.
- The number 3 is already available, so we can use it.
Therefore, the equation is 14 + 32 + 3 = 49.
 </think>
<answer> (14 + 32) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 35, 46, and 42 that equals 53. One way to approach this is to consider if we can combine these numbers in a way that subtraction might help us reach the target number.
46 + 42 = 88
Now, if we subtract 35 from 88, we get:
88 - 35 = 53
This gives us the equation we need: 46 + 42 - 35 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 42 - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 56, 78, and 70 exactly once to get 64. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to see if we can combine these numbers in a way that subtraction or addition can help us get to 64.
If we consider 78 - 70, we get 8. We need to get from 8 to 64, so we consider 8 * 8 = 64. This means we need to find two numbers that can generate an 8.
Notice that 78 - 70 = 8, and 56 is left. If we take 56 and subtract this 8, we get 56 - 8 = 48, which is too much. However, let's reframe the approach.
Let's consider:
(78 - 56) + 70 - 78
First, 78 - 56 = 22.
Then, 22 + 70 = 92.
Finally, 92 - 78 = 14.
This doesn't work.
Another approach:
(78 - 56) - 70 + 78
First, 78 - 56 = 22.
Then, 22 - 70 = -48.
Finally, -48 + 78 = 30.
This also doesn't work.
Let's try another:
56 + (78 - 70)
This simplifies to:
56 + 8 = 64.
This works. So, we need:
56 + (78 - 70) = 64.
</think>
<answer> 56 + (78 - 70) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 28, 8, and 2 that equals 22. I'll try combining the numbers using different operations.
Looking at the numbers, I notice that 28 and 2 can be combined to make a number close to 22, which is 30 (28 + 2).
Now I need to adjust this to 22 by subtracting 8 from 30.
So the equation would be: (28 + 2) - 8 = 22.
</think>
<answer> (28 + 2) - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 39, 99, 86, and 78 exactly once to get 52. 
First, I notice that 99 - 86 = 13, which isn't helpful. 
Considering 99 - 78 = 21 isn't directly leading to 52 either.
Then, I see if 99 - (39 + 86) is close: 99 - 125 = -26, too low.
If I rearrange to 99 - (39 + 78) = 99 - 117, I get -18, still not 52.
So, I try another combination. If I consider 99 - (39 + 86 - 78): 
99 - (39 + 86 - 78) = 99 - 47 = 52, which gives the desired result of 52.
</think>
<answer> 99 - (39 + 86 - 78) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 29 using the numbers 75, 69, and 23 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, notice that 75 - 69 = 6, which is close but doesn't help us get to 29.
If we look at 75 - 23 = 52, that's not 29 either.
Now, let's try 75 + 69 - 23:
75 + 69 = 144
144 - 23 = 121
That is too high. Let's try another approach:
69 - 23 = 46
Then we need 29, but we only have 46 and 75 left and 46 - 17 = 29 and 17 = 75 - 58 which is not possible.
Another approach could be:
Using the values 75 and 23, we can get 75 - 23 = 52. But we need to reach 29, so we need a negative value. Let's go this way:
75 - (69 + 23) will give us 75 - 92 = -17, which is not what we need.
Finally, an approach is:
69 - (75 - 23) will give us 69 - 52 = 17, which is not 29.
But, an effective combination:
69 - (75 - 23) gives 69 - 52 = 17, not 29.
Actually, we can simply use the numbers as:
75 - 69 + 23 = 17 + 23 = 40 - 11 = 29.
So, in the final step, we get:
75 - 69 + 23 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 69 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 60, 71, and 46 that equals 35. Let's consider different combinations of operations.
First, let's try to subtract or add these numbers to get closer to 35.
If I subtract 46 from 71, I get 25.
If I then subtract 60 from 25, I get -35, which is not 35.
Next, let's try multiplying and then adding or subtracting.
If I multiply 60 by 71 and then subtract 46, I get 4260 - 46 = 4214, which is far from 35.
Considering these options, let's try combining them differently.
If I add 46 to 60, I get 106.
Then, subtracting 71 from 106 gives me 35.
This works! So the equation is 106 - 71 = 35.
</think>
<answer> (60 + 46) - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 87 using the numbers 32, 59, 48, and 44. Let's start by considering if any combination of these numbers in a single arithmetic operation can get us close to 87.
- 59 is close to 87, so let's subtract it from 87: 87 - 59 = 28.
- Now, we need another number to reach 44 and then add the difference to get 87.
- Looking at 44, if we subtract 40 from it, we get 4. 
- We have a 32 left, and 44 - 4 = 40.
- So, 44 - 4 = 40, which, when added to 59, gives us 109, not 87.
- 48 can be used instead of 32, and we get: 48 + 4 = 52.
- Now, we have 59 + 52 = 111, which is too high.
- 48 - 4 equals 44, and when subtracted from 44, we should use 32 to make it 109 - 22.
- 59 + 44 = 103, then 87 - 103 + 22 = 87.
So, the equation that works is: 59 + 44 - 48 + 32 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 59 + 44 - 48 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 63 using the numbers 20, 27, and 70 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations and numbers.
One way to approach this is to see if the numbers allow us to reach 63 by a simple combination.
If we look at 70 - 27 = 43, we need an additional 20 to reach 63. However, this uses all three numbers, and we need to make sure we use them only once.
If we look at 70 - 20 = 50, then we would need 13 to reach 63, which is not available.
Now, let's try 70 + 20 = 90, then we would need to subtract 27 from 90 to get 63.
70 + 20 - 27 = 63.
This satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and getting the result 63.
</think>
<answer> 70 + 20 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 20, 27, and 70 exactly once to get 63. 
I can start by subtracting the smallest number from the sum of the other two to see if it gets me close to 63.
27 + 70 = 97
Now, 97 - 20 = 77, which is more than 63.
If I try 70 - 27 = 43, and then subtract the remaining 20, I get 43 - 20 = 23, which is still not 63.
Instead, let's consider if I can subtract the second largest number from the largest, and adjust.
70 - 27 = 43
Now, I need 20 more to reach 63. I can calculate 63 - 43 = 20, so it works.
Therefore, the equation is 70 - 27 + 20 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 27 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 25, 38, and 47 that equals 34. Each number can only be used once and we can use basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to use subtraction to get close to 34 and then adjust with another number.
If we subtract 47 from 38, we get -9. Then we need an equation that converts -9 to 34. We can add 38 + 9 to get 47, which is close to 34 with the adjustment.
However, a simpler and more direct approach is to subtract 25 from 38 and then add 47. This gives us:
38 - 25 + 47 = 34
We see that 38 - 25 is 13, and 13 + 47 is 60, which is incorrect.
Another direct approach working within the constraints is:
38 - 25 + 47 = 60, this is incorrect.
A correct simple way could be 25 + 47 - 38 = 34, where:
25 + 47 = 72, and then 72 - 38 = 34.
Thus, the correct equation is: 25 + 47 - 38 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 25 + 47 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 52, 52, and 25 to get an expression that equals 25. One approach is to consider if any of the numbers can be subtracted or if there's a way to make the 25 just by manipulating the 52s.
Let's try to subtract 25 from one of the 52s:
52 - 25 = 27
This isn't 25, but it's close. If we take away one 52 and add it to the other, we might be able to get to 25. So, let's do:
52 - 52 + 25
Now, 52 minus 52 equals 0, so we are left with:
0 + 25 = 25
Therefore, the equation is:
52 - 52 + 25 = 25
</think>
<answer> 52 - 52 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 53, 9, and 1 to make an equation that equals 63. Let's start by looking at the numbers we have and how they can be combined with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach could be to see if there's a way to use the numbers 53 and 9 together to make 62, and then add 1.
53 + 9 = 62
Now, we just need to add 1 to 62, which we can do with the number 1.
62 + 1 = 63
So, the equation is 53 + 9 + 1 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 53 + 9 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 24, 68, and 39 exactly once. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach could be to try different combinations. If I look closely, 68 - 39 = 29. Now, I need something that when added to 24 equals 53.
So, 53 - 29 = 24, which is exactly the third number I have.
Therefore, the equation is 68 - 39 + 24 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 39 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 51, 43, and 61 that equals 33, I need to consider all possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Multiplying any of these numbers will result in a number too large to reach 33.
- Dividing any number by itself does not change the number.
- If I subtract a smaller number from a larger one, it might bring me closer to 33.
Let's try 61 - 51 = 10, and then figure out how to get to 33 from 10. 
Next, consider 10 + 43 = 53, which is too large.
- Trying 43 - 10 = 33 is the way to reach 33.
So the equation is 43 - (61 - 51) = 33.
</think>
<answer> 43 - (61 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 22, 75, and 5 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the possible combinations:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to get us close to 48.
- Multiplying 75 by 5 gives 375, which is too high.
- Multiplying 75 by 22 would also be too high and wouldn't use the third number 5.
- If we multiply 22 by 5, we get 110, which is also too high.
- Adding the two largest numbers (75 and 22) gives 97, which is still far from 48.
Considering the above, we should look for other operations. 
It seems a combination of operations might be required. Let's try using division:
- If we divide 75 by 5, we get 15, which is not 48.
- Now, let's try subtracting. If we subtract the smaller number from the sum of the other two, we might get closer.
So, let's try: 75 - 22 + 5 = 53 + 5 = 58 (too high)
Then let's try subtracting in a different way:
(75 - 22) + 5 = 53 + 5 = 58 (still too high)
To reach 48, we need to tweak the equation. Notice that 75 - 22 = 53, which is very close but we need to decrease it further.
Considering division might be the key:
75 / 5 + 22 = 15 + 22 = 37 (too low)
Let's try another arrangement:
(75 - 22) / 5 = 53 /5 = 10.6 (not an integer and doesn't work for exact 48)
(75 - 22) / 5 + 5 = (53/5)+5 = 10+5 = 15 (not 48)
After all the trials, it seems incorrect but one notable attempt:
75 - 5 * 22 = 75 - 110 = -35 (not correct)
Notice that 57 is near to 48 let's improve 
Finally:
(75 - 22) - 5 = 53 - 5 = 48
</think>
<answer>(75 - 22) - 5</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 67, and 6 that equals 91. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to consider if the numbers can be combined using addition and subtraction:
- 67 + 30 = 97
- This is close but too high.
- Then try 67 - 30 = 37
- And then 37 + 6 = 43
- This is still too low.
Next, let's try multiplication and addition:
- 67 * 6 = 392
- This is far too high.
Then consider using division and addition or subtraction:
- 67 / 6 = 11.1666...
- This doesn't result in an integer.
Another approach is:
- 67 + 30 - 6 = 91
This seems promising as it uses all the numbers once and follows basic arithmetic rules.
</think>
<answer> 67 + 30 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 96, 46, and 27 exactly once to get 77. Let's see how these numbers can be combined.
One approach could be: 96 - 46 + 27
Let's calculate this:
96 - 46 = 50
50 + 27 = 77
So, the equation is 96 - 46 + 27 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 46 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 48, 96, and 32 that equals 64, I need to think about combining these numbers using arithmetic operations. One effective way could be to multiply 96 by 32 first, and then divide the result by 48.
So, (96 * 32) / 48 = 3072 / 48 = 64.
The equation works because multiplying 96 by 32 gives us 3072, and dividing 3072 by 48 indeed gives us 64.
</think>
<answer>(96 * 32) / 48</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 93, and 8 that equals 71. I'll try different combinations of the basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's start with 93 - 14 = 79, which is close but not 71. 
- Then, 79 + 8 = 87, which is not 71.
- Now, let's try 93 - 8 = 85, which is also not 71.
- What if we modify this further? How about 93 + 14 - 8?
  93 + 14 = 107
  107 - 8 = 99
  This is close but not 71.
- Finally, let's try another approach: 93 - 14 - 8 might work.
  93 - 14 = 79
  79 - 8 = 71
  This gives us the desired result of 71.
So, the equation is 93 - 14 - 8 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 14 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 14, 93, and 8 to get 71. First, let's consider adding and subtracting these numbers:
- If we add 14 and 93, we get 107. This is too high.
- If we subtract 8 from 14, we get 6. This is not close to 71.
- If we subtract 93 from 14, we get -79, which is not helpful.
Given these initial attempts, let's try multiplication and division:
- Multiplying any of these numbers would result in a number larger than 71 or not close enough.
- Dividing 93 by 14 gives approximately 6.64, which isn't 71 either.
Given the numbers we have, let's try another approach. Let's consider the possibility that combining two numbers and then performing an operation on that result could yield 71:
- If we consider 93 - 14 = 79, and then subtract 8 from 79, we get 71.
So, this sequence fits our criteria: 93 - 14 - 8 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 14 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 13, 82, and 34 in a way that their combination equals 61. I'll start by looking at the numbers and considering simple operations.
The number 82 seems quite large, so subtracting a smaller number from it might be a good starting point. If I subtract 34 from 82, I get 48.
Now, I need 13 more to reach 61. I could add 13 to the result, as 48 + 13 = 61.
Therefore, the equation is 82 - 34 + 13 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 34 + 13 </answer>

<think> I need to use the numbers 22, 96, and 24 exactly once to make 50. 
First, let's see if we can form 50 using these numbers. One way to approach it is to consider if the sum or difference of these numbers can get close to 50.
If we subtract 24 from 96, we get 72. Then, if we subtract 22 from 72, we get 50. This utilizes all three numbers.
So, the equation is 96 - 24 - 22 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 24 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 1, and 50 that equals 37. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If I use subtraction first, I can try 50 - 12 - 1, which gives 37. However, we can only use each number once.
- Let's try another combination: 50 - (12 + 1) = 37. This seems promising because it uses all three numbers exactly once.
- Verifying, it works: 50 - (12 + 1) = 50 - 13 = 37.
</think>
<answer> 50 - (12 + 1) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 5, 7, and 6 that equals 29. I'll start by considering possible combinations of operations:
- If I add 5 and 7, I get 12. Then 12 + 6 equals 18, which isn't 29.
- If I subtract 6 from 7, I get 1. Then 5 + 1 equals 6, which is far from 29.
- If I subtract 5 from 7, I get 2. Then 2 + 6 equals 8, still not 29.
- If I first multiply 5 by 7, I get 35. Then 35 - 6 equals 29, which is exactly what I need.
So the equation is 5 * 7 - 6 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 5 * 7 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 10, 27, and 7 that equals 10. I should try combining these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that if I subtract 7 from 10, I get 3, and then if I add 27 to that, I get 30, which is not 10.
27 - 10 = 17, which is not 10 either.
Multiplying or dividing the numbers doesn't seem to help achieve the target of 10.
However, if I take 27 and divide it by 7, I get approximately 3.857, and then if I add 10, it still doesn't equal 10. 
But if I try 27 - (10 * 7 / 10), I first do the division and multiplication:
27 - (1*7) = 27 - 7 = 20, which is not 10.
Then I realize that 10 - (27 / 7) gives me the right result. 
27 divided by 7 is roughly 3.857, and then subtracting this from 10 gives approximately 10 - 3.857 = 6.143, which isn't 10.
Looking back at the need to exactly get 10, the correct combination seems to be:
10 - (27 / 7) should be 10 - 3 = 7, not 10.
Rechecking, 27 - (10 + 7) = 27 - 17 = 10.
This works correctly.
So the equation is 27 - (10 + 7) = 10.
</think>
<answer> 27 - (10 + 7) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 37, 68, and 13 to create an equation that equals 18. I should start by considering what simple operations could get me close to 18.
- 13 is the smallest number, so I can try to use it in a way that other numbers around it can be transformed into 18.
- If I subtract 13 from 37, I get 24, which is close to 18. Now I need to get from 24 to 18 by using 68. 
- Subtracting 68 from 24 would overshoot, so instead, I could use division. 24 divided by 1.5 is 18, but 1.5 is not available. However, 68 divided by 13 is approximately 5.23, and 24 - 5.23 is not exactly 18. 
- Instead, let's try a different approach with operations on 37 and 68. If we see if we can reduce 68 with a subtraction of some from 37, it might work out. 
- 37 - 20 = 17, which is really close. Now, to reach 18, we need to reduce 17 by 1. This can be done by using 68 - (37 + 13) = 68 - 50 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 68 - (37 + 13) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 18 using the numbers 37, 68, and 13 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations.
First, let's consider if we can reach 18 by subtracting one number from another or a combination.
If we subtract 13 from 68, we get 55. If we then subtract 37 from 55, we get 18.
So, the equation would be 68 - 37 - 13 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 37 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 90, 20, and 95 in a way that results in 25. Let's consider the operations we can use.
First, I'll look if there's a simple combination that could equal 25:
- 95 - 90 = 5. Not 25.
- 95 - 20 = 75. Not 25.
- 90 - 20 = 70. Not 25.
Now, let's try multiplication and subtraction:
- 90 * 20 = 1800. This is clearly not 25.
- Let's try 95 * 20 / 90. This would be very complex, so let's try another combination:
Now, I'll try different combinations:
- 20 + (95 - 90) = 20 + 5 = 25.
This seems to work. Therefore, the equation is 20 + (95 - 90) = 25.
</think>
<answer> 20 + (95 - 90) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 24, 66, and 2 exactly once. Let's try combining these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to see if we can get close to 44 and then adjust. Let's try:
24 + 2 = 26
Now we need 18 more to reach 44.
66 - 2 = 64, but that's too much.
Let's try another way: 66 + 2 - 24 = 66 - 24 + 2 = 42 + 2 = 44
This works because 66 + 2 - 24 equals 44.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 2 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 94, 87, and 19 in an equation that equals 26. Let's try to use the numbers in different combinations with basic arithmetic operations.
First, notice that 94 and 87 are quite far from 26, so they may not be used directly. 19 is closer to 26, so it might be a better starting point. 
Let's see if we can combine 19 in a way to reach 26. One way to think is to try subtraction or addition:
19 + 87 = 106 (too high)
19 - 87 = -63 (too low)
We can also try other combinations but 19 + some number (like 94) gives a large number. Instead, let's try:
(94 - 87) = 7
Now if we use 7 and 19, we need to get 26:
19 + 7 = 26
This works! So the equation is:
19 + (94 - 87) = 26
</think>
<answer> 19 + (94 - 87) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 94, 87, and 19 that equals 26, we need to consider all possible combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to look for a combination where one of the numbers can be subtracted or added to or from another to reach 26.
If we subtract 19 from 87, we get:
87 - 19 = 68
Now, we need to combine 68 with the remaining number, 94, in some way to get 26. We can do this by subtracting 68 from 94:
94 - 68 = 26
So, the equation formed by these operations is:
94 - (87 - 19) = 26
</think>
<answer> 94 - (87 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find an equation that equals 85 using the numbers 48, 31, 12, and 6 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations and see if we can get the result.
One possible combination could be using addition and subtraction, and consider if there's a pattern or a difference that can quickly lead us to 85.
31 + 12 + 48 + 6 = 97, which is close but we need 85. 
If we switch the order of operations slightly:
6 + 12 + 31 * 48 / 8 shall we check if this works.
Breaking it down:
48 * 6 = 288
288 + 31 = 319
319 + 6 = 325 (too big)
Instead, perhaps we can try:
48 + 31 + 12 - 6
This gives: 91 (still too high)
Let me try:
(48 + 31 + 12) - 6
48 + 31 + 12 = 91
91 - 6 = 85
So, the equation is (48 + 31 + 12) - 6 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (48 + 31 + 12) - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 45, 7, and 5 exactly once to get 16. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible way could be: (45 - 5) - 7
Calculating step by step:
45 - 5 = 40
40 - 7 = 33
This doesn't equal 16, so this isn't the correct combination.
Another way could be: (45 - 7) / 5
Calculating step by step:
45 - 7 = 38
38 / 5 = 7.6
This also doesn't equal 16, so I'll try:
Another combination could be: (45 / 5) + 7
Calculating step by step:
45 / 5 = 9
9 + 7 = 16
This seems to be the correct combination.
</think>
<answer> (45 / 5) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 45, 7, and 5 exactly once to get the result 16. Let's consider the numbers and operations we can use.
A good approach could be to test different operations. Using division, I can try to utilize the large number (45) to make it possible to get the close value to 16.
Let's consider division of 45 by 5: 45 / 5 = 9.
Now we need 7 more to reach 16. We can see that 9 + 7 = 16.
So, the equation would be 45 / 5 + 7 = 16.
</think>
<answer> 45 / 5 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 90, 66, and 41 exactly once, we need to consider the operations that could lead to 65.
One way to approach this is to look at the differences and sums that might help us reach our target. 
First, let's observe the numbers:
- The difference between 90 and 66 is 24.
- The difference between 41 and 24 (which is 90 - 66) is 17, and the difference between 17 and 66 is 49 (which is 66 - 17).
If we use 90 - (66 - 41) we get:
90 - (66 - 41) = 90 - 25 = 65
So the equation is 90 - (66 - 41) = 65.
</think>
<answer> 90 - (66 - 41) </answer>

==============
<think> To get a result of 65 using the numbers 90, 66, and 41 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I should consider the range of numbers and how they interact with each other.
First, I notice that 90 and 66 are close to 65, so they might be good candidates for subtraction or addition.
If I subtract 90 from 66, I get -24. Now I have -24, 66, and 41. Adding these together gives me 187, which is too large.
If instead, I subtract 66 from 90, I get 24. Now I have 24, 66, and 41. If I subtract 24 from 66, I get 42. Now I have 42 and 41. Subtracting 41 from 42 gives me 1, which is not what I need.
This approach seems to be going in the wrong direction. Let's try a different combination.
I'll try 90 - (66 - 41). This simplifies to:
90 - 25 = 65
So, the equation is 90 - (66 - 41) = 65.
</think>
<answer> 90 - (66 - 41) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 93 using the numbers 45, 53, and 85 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's see if I can get close to 93 by adding or subtracting these numbers.
- Trying 53 + 85 - 45: This equals 93. This combination works well.
So the equation is 53 + 85 - 45 = 93.
</think>
<answer> 53 + 85 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to combine the numbers 41, 23, and 12 using basic arithmetic operations to get 76. One approach is to consider whether the numbers can be manipulated to reach the target sum directly, or if we need to use some combination of operations.
Let's try adding and subtracting the numbers:
41 + 23 = 64
Now, if we subtract 12 from 64:
64 - 12 = 52
This is still not 76, so let's try another combination:
41 + 12 = 53
And then add 23 to that result:
53 + 23 = 76
So, the numbers can be combined through addition to equal 76.
</think>
<answer> 41 + 12 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 94, 4, and 52 exactly once to make 46. Let's check the operations we have: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
First, I notice that 52 is the largest number and could be a good target for division, as it's above 46. I'll try to see if dividing 52 by 4 can get me closer to 46.
52 / 4 = 13
Now, I have the numbers 94 and 13. If I add 94 to 13, I get:
94 + 13 = 107
That's too high. Instead, I need to adjust by subtracting a smaller number from 94. 
If I subtract the remaining 4 from 94:
94 - 4 = 90
Now, adding this to 13:
90 + 13 = 103
That's still too high. 
Instead of subtraction, let me subtract 13 from 94:
94 - 13 = 81
And then subtract the 4 from 81:
81 - 4 = 77
This is still not 46, so I should backtrack and try another combination.
Since 52 is quite far from 46, subtracting 4 directly from 94 to get closer to 46 seemed like a better option. Let's try:
94 - (52 + 4 - 13) = 94 - 41 = 53
Looking closer again, I see if 46 is feasible by interchanging operations differently:
46 = 52 - 4 + 94 / 3
Calculate in sequence:
52 - 4 = 48
48 + (94 / 3) = (48) + (31.33...) = 79.33...
The closest feasible combination with exact arithmetic seems to remain 94 - (52 - 4 + 13) which results in 46, simplifying the process.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 52 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 94, 4, and 52 that results in 46. I can start by considering simple operations like addition and subtraction.
- Let's try subtracting 52 from 94: 94 - 52 = 42, which is not 46.
- Now, let's try adding 4 to 52: 52 + 4 = 56, which is too large.
- Let's try adding 4 to the result of subtracting 52 from 94: (94 - 52) + 4 = 42 + 4 = 46.
This works because it follows the rule that each number can only be used once.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 52) + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 89 using the numbers 17, 39, and 33 exactly once, I need to consider how I can combine these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 39 and 33 can be combined to make 72 (39 + 33 = 72). Now, I need to find a way to get from 72 to 89 using the remaining number 17.
Subtracting 17 from 72 gives me 55, which is far from 89. Adding 17 to 72 gives me 89, which is exactly what I need.
Thus, the equation is 39 + 33 + 17 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 33 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 17, 39, and 33 exactly once to create an equation that equals 89. I can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's start by looking at the possible sums and differences:
  - 39 + 33 = 72
  - 39 + 17 = 56
  - 33 + 17 = 50
  - 39 - 17 = 22
  - 33 - 17 = 16
  - 17 + 33 + 39 = 89 (This is the combination we're looking for)
From this, we can see that using 17 + 39 + 33 immediately gives us 89.
</think>
<answer> 17 + 39 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 37, 75, and 43 that equals 81. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, 75 is the largest number and 43 is the smallest, which means it might be useful to subtract 43 from 75 to get 32.
75 - 43 = 32
Now, I need to get to 81 from 32 using 37. Adding 37 to 32 would give me 69, which is not 81; subtracting 37 from 32 would give -7, which is not 81 either. However, I can multiply 32 by 1.5 to get 48, and then add 37 to get 81.
So, (75 - 43) * (37 / 2) = 81
Since 37 / 2 isn't an exact integer, this approach might not work. Let me try another method:
I can reach 81 by using 75 + 43 = 118 and then subtracting 37 from it.
75 + 43 - 37 = 81
This comes out to be a valid solution using all three numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 43 - 37 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 39, 48, and 60 exactly once to make 27. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One way to think about it is to see if any of the numbers can be combined in a way that results in a number close to 27, and then adjust with the other numbers.
60 - 48 = 12
Now, we need 15 more to reach 27. If we look at 39 and 12, we can use subtraction and addition:
39 - 60 + 48 = 27
This satisfies the requirement of using all numbers and performing only basic arithmetic operations once.
</think>
<answer> 39 - 60 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 12, 63, 55, and 60 exactly once to get 13. Let's try combining some of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible way could be: 63 - 55 - 12 + 60. 
Let's calculate this: 63 - 55 = 8, 
then, 8 - 12 = -4, and 
finally -4 + 60 = 56. This isn't 13, so this combination isn't correct.
Let's try another way: 63 - (55 + 12) + 60. 
First, we calculate the parentheses: 55 + 12 = 67.
Then we have 63 - 67 + 60 = 63 - 67 = -4, and -4 + 60 = 56. This also isn't 13.
It seems another approach is needed. Let's try: 63 - 55 - (60 - 12).
Calculating inside the parentheses first: 60 - 12 = 48. 
Then subtracting: 63 - 55 = 8, and finally 8 - 48 = -40. Not equal to 13.
Now let's try 63 - 55 + (12 - 60).
Inside the parentheses: 12 - 60 = -48. 
Then subtracting: 63 - 55 = 8, and finally adding: 8 + (-48) = -40. Still not equal to 13.
After trying some different combination, I realize the correct way is: (63 - 55) + (12 - 60 / 55).
Let's calculate this: 63 - 55 = 8, and 60 / 55 = 1.118 (approx), then 12 - 1.118 = 10. 8 + 10 = 18. Not correct.
A proper combination seems missing. Let's revise: (60 - 55) + (63 - 12).
Calculate inside the parentheses: 60 - 55 = 5, and 63 - 12 = 51. 
Now addition: 5 + 51 = 56. Still not 13.
Carefully evaluating combinations again: 
It must be: 63 - 55 = 8, now use remaining 12 + remaining 60 / 12 = 10. So correct form: 63 - 55 + 60 / 12 = 13.
Thus, the final equation is (63 - 55) + (60 / 12).
</think>
<answer> (63 - 55) + (60 / 12) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using 64, 74, and 66 that equals 76. Let's look at the numbers and consider the operations we can use.
One possibility is to use subtraction and addition:
74 - 64 + 66
(74 - 64) = 10
Then we add 66:
10 + 66 = 76
So, the equation that equals 76 is 74 - 64 + 66.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 64 + 66 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 17, 34, and 9 exactly once to make 42. Let's consider the operations we can use:
- First, 34 - 17 = 17
- Now, if we add 9 to this result: 17 + 9 = 26
- This is not 42, and we need to reach 42, so let's try another combination.
- Instead, let's try 34 + 9 = 43
- Now, if we subtract 17 from 43: 43 - 17 = 26
- This is still not 42, so we need to work with the original numbers differently.
- Another approach is to use multiplication and addition/subtraction:
- Consider 34 * 1 = 34 (This won't work as we need subtraction later)
- Instead, try: 34 - 17 + 9
- This gives us: 34 - 17 = 17 and then 17 + 9 = 26
- This still isn't 42, so I should rethink the operations.
- Now, I notice that:
- If we take 34 - 9 = 25, and then add 17, we get: 25 + 17 = 42
- This combination fits the requirement and uses each number exactly once.</think>
<answer> (34 - 9) + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 17, 34, and 9 exactly once to create an equation that equals 42. Let's try different combinations of the operations.
First, I'll try adding and subtracting: (17 + 34) - 9 = 48 - 9 = 39, which is close but not 42.
Next, let's try multiplying and adding: 17 * 34 / 9 = 578 / 9 ≈ 64.22, which is too large.
Now, let's try: 34 + 17 - 9 = 51 - 9 = 42, which is exactly 42.
So the equation that uses the numbers 17, 34, and 9 exactly once to get 42 is 34 + 17 - 9.
</think>
<answer> 34 + 17 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 34, and 9 that equals 42. I should try combining these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
Starting with the numbers I have, 34 is close to 42. If I subtract 17 from 34, I get 17. Now I have 17, 9, and I need 42. I need 42 = 17 + 9 + x, but that's not possible as 17 + 9 is 26 and doesn't get me to 42. 
Next, I'll try multiplication and addition. If I use 34 * 1, I get 34. Now I need 8 more to reach 42. Since I have 9 and 17, 9 + 17 does not work. 9 + 17 - 34 also doesn't work as 34 becomes negative.
Trying 34 - 9 gives me 25, and to get 42, I need 17 more. I have 17, so 25 + 17 = 42. Therefore, the equation is 34 - 9 + 17.
</think>
<answer> 34 - 9 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 39, 87, and 14 to equal 46. First, let's consider the possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. One way to approach this is to try to balance the equation around a central number or use a combination of operations to get close to 46.
66 + 39 = 105, which is too high.
66 - 39 = 27, still a bit high.
87 - 66 = 21, this is closer but still not 46.
Now, let's try 87 - 66 + 39 but that gives 58 which is too high.
87 - 66 - 39 = -18, this is the opposite direction.
Let's consider a different combination: 87 - (66 - 39) + 14
This simplifies to 87 - 27 + 14 = 66 + 14 - 27 = 80 - 27 = 53 which is still not 46.
Another way to view the numbers might be to use subtraction recursively:
87 - 66 = 21
Now, subtract 14: 21 - 14 = 7
Now subtract 39 from this result: 7 - 39 = -32
This still isn't correct.
I'll try a different approach:
87 - (66 - 39) + 14 = 87 - 27 + 14. Simplifying this gives 60 + 14 which is 74 which is too high again.
After revisiting all possibilities and finding no direct match, I realize another strategy might be to try little adjustments:
87 - 66 + 14 - 39 = 21 + 14 - 39 = 35 - 39 which is -4, still not right.
Now considering taking another look at:
87 - 66 = 21
21 + 39 = 60
Still invalid entries.
Finally I find probably the best approach after re-examining:
(87 - 66) * 14 / 39 = 21 * (14 / 39) = 21 / 39 = 0. 53... which is a small value.
I realize the best initial approach should focus on correct adjustments by prior considerations:
87 - 66 + 39 - 14 = 58 - 14 = 44, too small.
Learning from trial and error, considering I need to hit 46 pretty, the tightest focusing numbers show, would be:
87 - 66 + 39 - 14 = 46.
Thus after valid checks, the equation is: 87 - 66 + 39 - 14 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 66 + 39 - 14 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 92, 2, and 79 that equals 15. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Multiplying and dividing would change the large magnitude of 92 and 79, so that might not be ideal for getting 15.
- Let's try subtraction: If we subtract 79 from 92, we get 13. Then we would need to subtract 8 to get 15, but 8 is not one of our numbers.
- Let's try addition: If we add 2 to 79, we get 81, which is too large.
- Let's try adding and subtracting: We can subtract 79 and then add 2 to 92. But, 92 - 79 = 13, and 13 + 2 = 15.
Therefore, the equation that works is 92 - 79 + 2 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 79 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 80, 35, and 29 in a way that the equation equals 74. I'll start by looking at the possible combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 80 + 35 + 29 = 144 (Too high)
- 80 + 35 - 29 = 86 (Too high)
- 80 + 29 - 35 = 74 (This looks promising)
- 80 - 35 + 29 = 74 (Also works)
- 80 * 35 / 29 = 103.7 (Not exactly 74)
- 80 / 35 * 29 = 65.43 (Not 74)
From these calculations, we see that 80 + 29 - 35 and 80 - 35 + 29 both give us 74. So either one is a valid solution.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 29 - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 80 using the numbers 42, 75, and 47 exactly once, we need to try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One approach is to consider whether we can use the numbers in a way that combines addition and subtraction to get close to 80.
We can try:
(75 + 47) - 42 = 122 - 42 = 80
So the equation is (75 + 47) - 42 = 80.
</think>
<answer> (75 + 47) - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 80 using the numbers 42, 75, and 47, one approach is to see if we can combine them using basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's look at the differences between the numbers:
75 - 47 = 28
42 - 28 = 14
In this case, it seems combining the numbers directly isn't leading us to our target. Let's try multiplication and addition:
75 * 47 / 42
Calculating each part:
75 * 47 = 3525
3525 / 42 = 84.07 (approximately 80 if disregarding decimals)
This tells us that 75 * 47 / 42 doesn't quite give us 80, but it's close. Let's try another combination:
47 * 42 - 75
Calculating the parts:
47 * 42 = 1974
1974 - 75 = 1899 (This is far from 80)
Given that the direct multiplications and addition/subtraction don't work easily to hit our target, perhaps we need to revisit potential pairings and operations:
(75 - 47) * 42 / 10 = 84, which is close but we're still missing that by 4
What if we try:
(75 - 47) * (42 / 75) + 42
(75 - 47) = 28
28 * (42 / 75) = 14.72
14.72 + 42 = 56.72
Again, not quite 80.
Given that directly manipulating these combinations hasn't taken us to 80, it seems there must be a combination other than those we've tried.
Our most promising effort without decimals in this case is:
75 + 42 - 47 = 70 (which is 10 less than 80)
This indicates we missed the arithmetic part where directly using subtraction and addition is less precise:
Correct approach directly:
75 + (47 - 42) = 75 + 5 = 80
This works as 47 - 42 = 5 and adding 75 gives 80.
</think>
<answer> 75 + (47 - 42) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 67, 57, 5, and 58 that equals 71. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 67 + 57 - 58 = 74 (not 71)
- 67 + (57 - 58) = 67 (not 71)
- (67 - 57) + 58 = 58 (not 71)
- 67 + (57 + 5 - 58) = 67 + 4 = 71 (this works)
So the equation 67 + (57 + 5 - 58) = 71 is correct.
</think>
<answer> 67 + (57 + 5 - 58) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 12, 26, and 26. One way to do this is by adding the two 26's together and then subtracting 12. 
26 + 26 = 52
52 - 12 = 40
So the equation is 26 + 26 - 12 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 26 + 26 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to get an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 97, 41, 32, and 12 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try combining numbers for addition first:
- If I add 97 and 32, I get 129.
- Then, if I subtract 41 and 12, I get 29. 
- Adding these results gives me 129 + 29 = 158, which is too high.
Now let's try a different combination:
- If I add 41 and 32, I get 73.
- Then, if I subtract 97 and 12, I get -115.
- Subtracting -115 from 73 gives me 73 - (-115) = 188, which is also too high.
Considering these combinations don't work and to get closer to 76, let's try a different approach:
- Adding 97 and 12 gives 109.
- Subtracting 41 and 32 gives -73.
- So, 109 + (-73) = 36, which is still not right.
It seems we need to test other combinations. 
- Adding 41 to 32 gives 73.
- Subtracting 97 and 12 gives -115.
- Thus, 73 - (-115) = 188, again too high.
Now, let's combine two pairs of numbers:
- Multiplying 32 and 12 gives 384.
- Subtracting 97 and 41 gives -138.
- Thus, 384 - (-138) = 384 + 138 = 522, which is too large.
Given these attempts, no straightforward combination using +, -, *, / works exactly. However, a simpler and required combination that happens to work, without needing complex operations, could be:
- Adding 97 and 12 gives 109.
- Subtracting 41 from the result, as it simplifies and gets us closer to 76: 109 - 41 = 68.
- Subtracting 32 to finally get 76: 68 - 32 = 36, and continuing to adjust moves us to get 76.
However, the correct straightforward and single equation combing numbers and basic operations totals 76, not through combinations.
Looking at options, we confirm:
97 - 41 + 32 - 12 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 41 + 32 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 55 using the numbers 4, 59, and 8 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations.
One possible approach is to see if we can make use of addition or subtraction to get close to 55 and then adjust with multiplication or division.
59 is quite large, so subtracting 59 from 8 or 4 will not work since we need a positive result. Let's try adding 4 and 8 first:
4 + 8 = 12
Now we need 43 more to reach 55. Since 59 is too large, 55 - 12 = 43, we can use 59 - 12. But we need this as a single number. Let's recheck:
59 - (8 - 4) = 59 - 4 = 55
This equation equals 55 using each of the numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
</think>
<answer> 59 - (8 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 63 using the numbers 66, 77, and 54 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. 
I'll try to manipulate these numbers with different operations. 
Let's consider the number 54. If I subtract 54 from 66, I get 12. 
Now if I add 77 to 12, I get 99, which is too large.
Instead, let's try subtracting 77 from 66, which gives -11.
Then if I add 54 to -11, I get 43, which is still not 63.
Now, let's try a different approach. If I take 77 and add 54, I get 131. 
Now if I subtract 131 from 66, I get -65, which is not correct.
It seems the combination of addition and subtraction might not work directly.
Let's consider multiplication and division. If I consider 77 * 54 / 66, first 77 * 54 gives 4158. 
Then, 4158 / 66 is approximately 63.00.
This operation seems to correctly give us 63 when all numbers are used exactly once.
So the equation that works is 77 * 54 / 66 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 77 * 54 / 66 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to get 91 using the numbers 90, 56, 13, and 70. Let's try combining numbers and operations.
First, let's see if we can get close to 91 using any pair of these numbers. Adding 90 and 13 gives us 103, which is too high. Subtracting 13 from 90 gives us 77, which is also not 91.
Let's try subtracting 70 from 90: 90 - 70 = 20. Now we need an additional 71 more to reach 91. We only have 56 left, and we can't make 71 with 56 using basic arithmetic operations.
Next, let's try using 56. Adding 56 to our current 20 gives us 76, which is still not 91. The next logical step is to see if we can use multiplication or division differently.
Since nothing above works by combining numbers directly, let's think if using division helps: if we divide 56 by 4, we get 14. Now we need to get from 20 to -77, which is impossible with remaining numbers.
Finally, let's test another combination: (90-56)+13 = 47. We still need 44 more to reach 91. Dividing 70 by 1.666... (a repeating decimal that we can approximate to 2 provides us with 35). Adding these gives 47+35 = 82, which is close but still short of 91. No closer seems without changing the combination.
Looking back, if 90-56 = 34 and combine 13 + 56 = 69
It's now clear nothing works as required using basic operations, therefore the task as posed: 90 - 56 + 70 - 13 or a combination involving other missing number combinations.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 56) + 70 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 97, and 66 that equals 84. I'll try different combinations of the operations and numbers.
One possible solution could be: 97 - 66 - 53
Let's break it down:
97 - 66 = 31
31 - 53 = -22
But this is not giving us 84.
Next, let's try: 97 - 66 + 53
97 - 66 = 31
31 + 53 = 84
This gives us the result we need.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 66 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 46, 43, and 63 exactly once. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's consider adding the smaller two numbers: 43 + 46 = 89
- Then, 89 - 63 = 26
- This doesn't work, as we need 66.
- Next, let's try another combination: 46 + 63 = 109
- Then, 109 - 43 = 66
This gives us our solution: 46 + 63 - 43 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 63 - 43 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 97, 60, and 95 exactly once to equal 62. Let's try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
One possible combination is: (97 - 95) + 60
Let's calculate this:
(97 - 95) + 60 = 2 + 60 = 62
This gives us the desired result of 62.
</think>
<answer>(97 - 95) + 60</answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 4, 13, and 7 that equals 95. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One approach could be to use exponentiation, multiplication, and addition: (13 * 7) + 4. This gives us:
13 * 7 = 91
Then we add 4: 91 + 4 = 95
So the equation is (13 * 7) + 4.
</think>
<answer>(13 * 7) + 4</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 50 using the numbers 25, 48, and 73 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
First, let's consider multiplication and addition/subtraction:
25 * 2 = 50, but 2 is not in the set {25, 48, 73}
25 * 2 + 0 = 50, but 0 is not in the set
Now let's try 48 + 73 - 25:
48 + 73 = 121
121 - 25 = 96
This is too high. Let's try:
48 + 73 - (25 * 0), but 0 is not in the set
Let's try:
73 + (48 - 25)
48 - 25 = 23
73 + 23 = 96
Still too high. Let's try:
48 + (73 - 25)
73 - 25 = 48
48 + 48 = 96
Still too high. Let's try:
25 + 48 + 73 - (25 * 0), but this is just 25 + 48 + 73
25 + 48 + 73 = 146
None of these work out. Let's try:
73 - (48 - 25)
73 - 23 = 50
This works!
So the correct equation is 73 - 48 + 25 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 48 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 71, 35, and 30 exactly once. I can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 71 + 35 = 106
- 71 + 30 = 101
- 71 - 35 = 36
- 71 - 30 = 41
- 35 + 30 = 65
- 35 - 30 = 5
Adding or subtracting any two of these numbers from the third one doesn't give me 76.
The next thing to try is:
71 - 35 + 30 = 66
71 + 35 - 30 = 76
This last combination gives me the result of 76.
</think>
<answer> 71 + 35 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 4, 84, and 11 exactly once to result in 77. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 84 - 4 - 11 = 71, which is close but not 77. 
- 84 - 4 + 11 = 91, which is more than 77.
- 84 + 4 - 11 = 77, this looks promising.
So, the equation 84 + 4 - 11 equals 77.
</think>
<answer> 84 + 4 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 65, 99, and 4 to create an equation that equals 30. Let's start by considering different combinations of operations.
- Adding or subtracting 65 and 99 will give us a very large number which is not what we need.
- Let's try multiplication and division next.
- Multiplying 65 by 4 gives 260, which is far from 30.
- Dividing 65 by 4 gives 16.25, which also doesn't help.
- Now, let's think about division and subtraction: If we divide 99 by 4, we get 24.75, and then subtracting 65 from this result doesn't seem promising.
- Let's try another approach: 99 - 65 = 34, and then dividing 34 by 4 will give 8.5, which still doesn't help.
- Finally, let's consider 99 - 65 = 34. Now, if we take 34 and subtract 4, we get 30: 34 - 4 = 30.
So, the equation is 99 - 65 - 4 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 65 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 72, 9, and 41, with each number used only once. Let's consider possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 72 - 9 - 41 = 22 (not 40)
- 72 - 9 + 41 = 104 (not 40)
- 72 + 9 - 41 = 32 (not 40)
- 72 + 41 - 9 = 104 (not 40)
- 9 + 41 - 72 = -12 (not 40)
- 9 * (72 / 41) does not result in an integer.
- (72 / 9) + 41 = 34 + 41 = 75 (not 40)
- (72 / 41) + 9 = 1.755 + 9 (not an integer)
Let's try another combination: 
- 9 * 41 - 72 = 369 - 72 = 297 (not 40)
- 9 + (72 / 41) = 9 + 1.755 ≈ 10.755 (not 40)
Then consider:
- 41 + 72 - 9 = 104 - 9 = 95 (not 40)
- 41 + (72 / 9) = 41 + 8 = 49 (not 40)
Finally:
- (72 - 41) + 9 = 31 + 9 = 40. That's correct! </think>
<answer> (72 - 41) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 63, 24, and 60 that results in 27. Let's consider the operations we can use, which include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If I start with 63 - 24, I get 39.
- This is close to 27, but not quite there. I need to reduce it by 12.
- I notice that 60 divided by 4 equals 15, but I need to get to 27 and -12 is negative 12.
- So, if I take 60 / 4, I get 15 and then I need to subtract 3 from this result to get 27.
- Therefore, 60 / 4 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12, but we need to subtract 15 from 27.
- Hence, I need 24 minus 15 to achieve this goal.
- Therefore, using 24 - (60 / 4) equals 24 - 15 which gives us 9, but still not 27.
- We need to adjust to ensure we get 27. If I take 24 - 60 / 4, then it gives 24 - 15 = 9, which isn't the final step.
- Another trial could be to consider 63 - 24 + 60 / 4.
- This evaluates to 63 - 24 + 15 = 39 + 15 = 54, still not 27.
- Checking manually, let's reconsider basic trials.
- 60 - (63 - 24) = 60 - 9 = 51, too high.
- Reattempt straightforward nearest basic easier operations: now rechecking 63 - 24 + 60/4 = 63 - 24 + 15 = 54, needing intermediate adjustment.
- After closer rechecking another consideration pairs:
- Finally, considering direct adjustments, 24 + (63 - 60) = 24 + 3 = 27.
- Final summation ensures 24 + (63 - 60) = 27. 
</think>
<answer> 24 + (63 - 60) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 19, 21, 55, and 58 that equals 73. Let's try to use the operations in a way that could yield the target number.
One approach is to consider adding or subtracting the numbers and possibly multiplying or dividing to reach 73.
If I add 55 and 19, I get 74.
If I then subtract 21 from 74, I get 53.
Finally, subtracting 58 from 53 would give me -5, which is not what I need.
If I subtract 19 and 21 first, I get -40, and then adding 55 gives me 15. This is still not 73.
Another approach is to try different combinations.
If I multiply 21 and 3, I get 63. Adding 10 does not give me 73.
Considering division might help here.
By dividing 58 by 21, I get approximately 2. 76, which is close to 2. 77. Then subtracting 19 from this result would give very close to 73.
Let me check: 
58 / 21 ≈ 2. 76
2. 76 - 19 = -16. 24
Not quite.
But if I rearrange the numbers:
58 - 55 = 3
3 + 21 = 24
24 + 19 = 43
Which doesn't work either.
A different approach:
By trying 58 - 55 = 3, adding 21 gives 24, and then 19 would make it 43. And then adding 20 doesn't fit.
But if I recalculate:
58 - (21 + 19) = 58 - 40 = 18
Then add 55 and 21 - 18 = 37
Or another:
58 - 21 = 37, 37 + 19 = 56, add 55 = 71.
So:
58 - (21+19) + 55 = 73
That's correct!</think>
<answer> 58 - (21 + 19) + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 64, 23, 35, and 45 exactly once to get 39. Let's try different combinations of the operations.
First, 64 - 45 = 19, which is too high.
Then consider 64 - 35 = 29.
Next, we can subtract smaller from larger: 29 - 23 = 6.
We need to get to 39; starting from 29, we need to get 13 more, and we can get 13 from 35 - 22, but 22 is not in the list.
Now let's try another approach: 64 - 35 = 29, then 45 - 23 = 22, but 22 is not in the list.
Finally, let's check if there's a way we can get 39 by using all the numbers once with addition and subtraction:
Take 45 + 23 = 68, which is far too high.
Let's try 64 - 35 = 29, and try different additions and subtractions.
45 - 23 = 22, this is not needed.
Then from 64 + 23 = 87, which is way too high.
We need to try operations in a different order.
Consider: 45 + 23 = 68, this is too high.
Now try: 64 - (45 + 23) = 64 - 68 = -4, this is incorrect.
Now try 45 + (64 - 23 - 35) = 45 + (64 - 58) = 45 + 6 = 51, this is far too high.
By trial and error, finding the correct combination does not seem straightforward, possibly missing a simpler route:
35 + 23 - 45 = 8, now need 31 more.
Trying: 64 - 23 = 41, and 41 - 35 = 6, far incorrect.
Finally correct sequence, indeed:
35 + 23 = 58 - 19 = 39
Hence the final equation:
(35 + 23) - (64 - 45) = 39.
</think>
<answer> (35 + 23) - (64 - 45) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 32, 86, and 27 that equals 81, I need to consider all possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, I notice that 86 - 32 = 54, which is close to 81, but not quite there.
Next, I consider 86 - 54 (which is 32) + 27, which simplifies to 13 + 27 = 40.
That's not it, but it gives me an idea. I need a larger number to get to 81.
Then, I consider 86 - 32 = 54 and then adding 27: 54 + 27 = 81.
This works perfectly. So the equation is 86 - 32 + 27 = 81.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 32 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 32, 86, and 27 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. 
First, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication and addition:
(86 - 32) + 27 = 54 + 27 = 81
The calculation shows that the equation (86 - 32) + 27 equals 81.

<answer>(86 - 32) + 27</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 45, and 54 that equals 21. I'll try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider division since it helps reduce numbers:
- 54 / 30 = 1.8 (not 21)
- 54 / 45 = 1.2 (not 21)
- 45 / 30 = 1.5 (not 21)
Next, let's try combining these numbers with addition and subtraction:
- 30 + 45 - 54 = 21 (This works)
So, the equation 30 + 45 - 54 equals 21.
</think>
<answer> 30 + 45 - 54 </answer>

==============
<think> To get an equation that equals 29 using the numbers 50, 93, and 72 exactly once, I need to consider the arithmetic operations available. One effective way is to take the difference of 93 and 72, and then subtract 50 from that result.
93 - 72 = 21
21 - 50 = -29
However, this gives us the negative value we want, but we want 29. So, let's try rearranging: 
(93 - 72) + (-50) = -29
This isn't quite right. Instead, let's try:
72 - (50 - 93) = 72 - (-43) = 72 + 43 = 115
It's not working. Let's try it another way:
93 - 72 - 50 = 21 - 50 = -29
Still not it. Let's try subtraction in a different order:
72 - 93 + 50 = -21 + 50 = 29
This gives us the correct result 29. So the equation is 72 - 93 + 50 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 93 + 50 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that gives us 79 using the numbers 76, 95, and 92 exactly once. I'll try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
- Let's try multiplication and subtraction: (95 * 92) - 76. This gives 8820 - 76 = 8744, which is too high.
- Now, let's try subtraction and addition: 95 - 76 + 92. This gives 19 + 92 = 111, which is still too high.
- Next, let's try subtraction and multiplication: 95 - 92 + 76. This results in 3 + 76 = 79, which is the target number.
So, the equation is 95 - 92 + 76 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 92 + 76 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 55, 62, and 27 exactly once to get 20 as the result. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If I use subtraction, I could try 62 - 55 = 7, but this is not what I need.
- If I use division, I would have to express 20 as 62 / x or 55 / x for some integer x. But dividing 55 or 62 by any integer other than 1 or itself won't give 20.
- If I use multiplication, then 27 * y = 20, and again no integer y will give this.
- Now, let's try combinations with addition and subtraction: 
  62 - 55 = 7, and then 7 - 27 = -20, which is too low.
  62 - 27 = 35, and then 35 - 55 = -20, which is also too low.
  55 - 27 = 28, and then 28 - 62 = -34, which is also not right.
  But what about 55 - 62 + 27? Let's see:
  55 - 62 = -7 and -7 + 27 = 20.
This combination works. Therefore, the equation is 55 - 62 + 27 = 20.
</think>
<answer> 55 - 62 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 55, 62, and 27 exactly once and results in 20. Let's try some combinations:
- 55 - 62 + 27 = 12 + 27 = 39 (not 20)
- 55 + 62 - 27 = 117 - 27 = 90 (not 20)
- 55 + (62 - 27) = 55 + 35 = 90 (not 20)
- (55 - 27) + 62 = 28 + 62 = 90 (not 20)
- 62 - (55 - 27) = 62 - 28 = 34 (not 20)
- 62 + (55 - 27) = 62 + 28 = 90 (not 20)
It seems I haven't found a combination yet. Let's try another sequence:
- 62 - (55 + 27) = 62 - 82 = -20 (not 20)
- (62 + 27) - 55 = 89 - 55 = 34 (not 20)
It appears none of these work. But then I have a different combination:
- (62 - 55) + 27 = 7 + 27 = 34 (not 20)
- (55 + 27) - 62 = 82 - 62 = 20 (this works!)
Thus the equation is 55 + 27 - 62 = 20.
</think>
<answer> (55 + 27) - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 91, and 77 that equals 73. I should try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the numbers themselves:
95 + 91 = 186
95 + 77 = 172
91 + 77 = 168
None of these are 73.
Let's try combining them with subtraction:
95 - 91 = 4
95 - 77 = 18
91 - 77 = 14
Still not 73.
Let's try different operations, like combining multiple numbers:
95 - 91 = 4
Then trying to use 77:
4 + 77 = 81 (too high)
95 - 77 = 18
Then trying 91:
91 - 77 = 14 (too low)
Combining in another way:
91 - (95 - 77) = 91 - 18 = 73
So the equation is: 91 - (95 - 77) = 73.
</think>
<answer> 91 - (95 - 77) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 46 using the numbers 3, 32, 55, and 38 exactly once. Let's try combining them in different ways:
- First, let's see if any simple operations can combine two numbers to approach 46.
- Adding 32 and 14 would give 46, but 14 is not in our set of numbers.
- Let's try 55 - 9 = 46, but 9 is not in our set.
- Now, let's try combining 32 and 38: 32 + 38 = 70, which is close but not 46.
- What if we try multiplication and addition? Let's see if 32 * 1. 5 = 46. But 1. 5 is not an integer.
- Let's try 55 - 32 = 23, and then we need 23 more to reach 46. This would mean we need 23 from 3 and 38, but 38 is already used.
- Finally, let's try 55 - 38 = 17, and then we need 29 more to reach 46. We can get 29 from 32 - 3 = 29.
So, the equation is 55 - 38 + (32 - 3) = 46.
</think>
<answer> 55 - 38 + (32 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 42, 99, and 17 which equals 40. One approach is to consider if any of these numbers can be combined in such a way that when combined with the others through basic arithmetic, we get 40.
- If I subtract 17 from 99, I get 82.
- If I subtract 42 from 82, I get 40.
Therefore, the equation is 99 - 42 - 17 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 42 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 70, 45, and 24 exactly once to get the result of 49. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One potential combination is: 70 - 45 + 24
Let's check this:
70 - 45 = 25
25 + 24 = 49
This combination works. So the equation is 70 - 45 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 45 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 96 using the numbers 53, 55, and 12 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, I notice that the target number 96 is close to 100, so I can consider adding or subtracting a small number to reach that.
100 - 55 = 45 is not 96.
100 - 53 = 47 is not 96 either.
Now let's try 100 - 12, which equals 88. This is close to 96, so let's see if we can bridge the difference using addition.
53 + 12 = 65, and then 88 + 65 = 153, which is too much.
Let's try another combination: 100 - 12 - 53 = 35, and then adding 55 which gives us 90. This is close but not 96.
Let's see if we can do this differently: consider multiplication or division as well.
55 * 12 = 660 is too large.
53 * 12 = 636 is also too large.
Now let's try different simple additions/subtractions with multiplication:
(55 - 12) * 53 = 43 * 53 = 2279 (too big), (55 + 12) * 53 = 67 * 53 = 3551 (too big).
Then I realize that we need something simpler:
(55 - 12) + 53 = 43 + 53 = 96
So, one possible equation is (55 - 12) + 53 = 96.
</think>
<answer>(55 - 12) + 53</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 97 using the numbers 11, 65, and 43, with each number used only once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's check if we can use the numbers directly in a way that they add up to 97:
11 + 65 + 43 = 120 (too high)
65 + 43 + 11 = 119 (still too high)
11 + 43 + 65 = 119 (again, still too high)
Now, let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
65 - 43 = 22
22 + 11 + 43 = 76 (not 97)
Let's try another combination:
65 + 43 - 11 = 97
This gives us the correct result of 97.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 43 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 19, 71, and 16. Let's try different combinations:
1. 71 - 19 - 16 = 36 (not 68)
2. 71 - 19 + 16 = 68 (this looks promising)
3. 71 + 19 - 16 = 74 (not 68)
4. 71 + 19 + 16 = 106 (not 68)
From the above combinations, it is clear that 71 - 19 + 16 equals 68.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 19 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 91, 70, and 95 exactly once to get 74 as the result. One approach is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's start with the operations and numbers we have:
95 - 91 = 4
Then adding 70 doesn't give us 74, so let's try:
95 - 91 + 70 = 74
This gives us the desired result of 74 using all three numbers exactly once with only one operation application.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 91 + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 81, 65, and 54 that equals 70. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 81 - 65 + 54 = 70
  Here, we subtract 65 from 81 to get 16, then add 54 to get 70.
- Checking other combinations like 81 + 65 - 54, 81 * 65 / 54, etc., doesn't yield 70.
Therefore, the equation that works is 81 - 65 + 54 = 70.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 65 + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 85 using the numbers 38, 16, and 63, one possible approach is to use a combination of addition and subtraction.
First, let's try adding 38 and 63: 
38 + 63 = 101
Next, we need to get from 101 to 85, so we can subtract 16:
101 - 16 = 85
So the equation using the numbers 38, 16, and 63 that equals 85 is 38 + 63 - 16.
</think>
<answer> 38 + 63 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 94, 44, and 83 that equals 33. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look for a combination where one of the numbers can be subtracted or added in a way that balances out to 33.
Let's try 94 - 44 - 83:
94 - 44 - 83 = 0 - 83 = -83
This doesn't work because we need a positive 33.
Let's try 94 - 44 + 83:
94 - 44 + 83 = 50 + 83 = 133
This is too high.
Let's try 94 - (44 + 83):
94 - (44 + 83) = 94 - 127 = -33
This is close but we need 33, not -33.
Given our options, it seems we can't form the equation using subtraction and addition of the three numbers as is. Now let's try another combination, 83 + 44 - 94:
83 + 44 - 94 = 127 - 94 = 33
This gives us 33, which is our target number.
</think>
<answer> 83 + 44 - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 32, 10, and 48 that equals 15. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's consider the possibility of using addition and subtraction:
32 + 10 - 48 = 5 (too high)
32 - 10 + 48 = 30 (too high)
Then, let's try multiplication and addition:
32 * 10 + 48 = 320 + 48 = 368 (too high)
Next, let's try multiplication and subtraction:
32 * 10 - 48 = 320 - 48 = 272 (too high)
Finally, let's try division and addition:
10 * 48 / 32 = 480 / 32 = 15
This works because 480 divided by 32 equals 15. </think>
<answer> 10 * 48 / 32 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 60, 6, and 11 that equals 21. One way to approach this is to look at the possible combinations of these numbers with the arithmetic operations.
Let's try the following combination: (60 - 6) - 11
(60 - 6) gives us 54
54 - 11 gives us 43
This does not equal 21.
Now let's try: (60 - 11) / 6
This gives us: 49 / 6 which is approximately 8.16
This also does not equal 21.
Next, let's try: (60 + 6) - 11 
This gives us: 66 - 11 = 55
This still doesn't equal 21.
Finally, let's try: (60 / 6) + 11
This gives us: 10 + 11 = 21
This does equal 21.
So the equation is (60 / 6) + 11.
</think>
<answer> (60 / 6) + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 21 using the numbers 60, 6, and 11 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding 60 and 6 and 11 gives 77, which is too high.
- Subtracting the smallest from the largest (60 - 11) gives 49, which is still too high.
- Multiplying some of them and adding: 60 * 6 / 11 = 34.5 (not an integer and not 21).
- Another possible combination is 60 - 11 - 6 = 43, which is also too high.
- Let's try 60 - 11 / 6, which equals 58.333, again not 21.
- Let's try 60 / 6 + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21. This looks promising!
Thus, the equation that equals 21 is 60 / 6 + 11.
</think>
<answer> 60 / 6 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 31, 1, and 53 exactly once to get 21. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 31 + 1 - 53 = 4 but that's not 21.
- Multiplying and adding: 31 * 1 + 53 = 84 but that's too big.
- Subtraction and addition: 31 - 53 + 1 = -11 but that's wrong because we need 21.
- Multiplication and subtraction: 53 * 1 - 31 = 22 but that's not 21.
- Combination of addition and subtraction: (31 + 1) - 53 = 9 but again not 21.
After trying these combinations, it seems I didn't find the right combination yet. Let's try 53 - 31 - 1 = 11 which is close but not exactly 21, but if we rearrange it: 53 - 31 - 1 could be 53 - (31 + 1) = 53 - 32 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 31 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 66, and 53 that equals 46. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
73 + 66 - 53 = 89 (This is too high)
73 + 53 - 66 = 59 (This is still too high)
66 + 53 - 73 = 46 (This looks promising)
So the equation 66 + 53 - 73 = 46 works.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 53 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 4, 11, and 19 that equals 26. I should try different combinations of the operations and the numbers.
First, let's consider the numbers themselves:
4 + 11 + 19 = 34, which is not 26.
4 * 11 + 19 = 53, which is not 26.
11 + 4 * 19 = 87, which is not 26.
Now, let's try 19 + 11 - 4:
19 + 11 - 4 = 26.
This satisfies the condition of using each number only once and results in 26.
</think>
<answer> 19 + 11 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 26 using the numbers 4, 11, and 19 exactly once, we can try different combinations of the operations.
One way to approach this is to consider multiplication and addition:
19 + 11 = 30
30 - 4 = 26
So, the equation is 19 + 11 - 4 = 26.
</think>
<answer> 19 + 11 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 12, and 89 that equals 56. Let's try different combinations of the arithmetic operations:
- If I try 45 - 12 - 89, I get -15 which is not 56.
- Trying 45 - 12 + 89 gives me 122 which is too high.
- Attempting 45 + 12 - 89 gives me -32 which is not 56.
- Using 45 + 89 - 12 yields 122 - 12 = 110, still not right.
- Let's try 89 + 12 - 45, which gives 101 - 45 = 56.
So, the equation that satisfies the condition is 89 + 12 - 45 = 56.
</think>
<answer> 89 + 12 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 48, 9, and 70 that equals 13. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to see if any simple combination of these numbers works directly or if we need to rearrange them.
48 - 9 gives 39.
39 - 70 gives -31.
This isn't 13, though -31 is too large and negative.
48 - 70 gives -22.
This is closer but still not 13.
Now let's try 70 - 48 = 22.
Then, 22 - 9 = 13.
This gives us 13.
So we use the equation: 70 - 48 - 9 = 13.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 48 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 8, 33, and 14 that equals 58. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's see if we can make use of 14 in some way: 69 - 33 = 36, which is not 58.
- Then, let's try combining it with the other numbers: 69 - 33 + 14 = 43, still not 58.
- Now, let's try a different combination: 69 - 33 - 14 = 22, still not 58.
- Then, let's explore multiplication and division: 69 + 8 + 33 - 14 = 96, which is too high.
- Now, let's try a different approach: 69 + 8 - 33 + 14 = 58. This calculation works as 69 + 8 equals 77, then subtracting 33 gives 44, and adding 14 results in 58.
So, the equation that equals 58 is: 69 + 8 - 33 + 14 = 58.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 8 - 33 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 69, 8, 33, and 14 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One approach is to combine the numbers in a way that one of them can be subtracted or added to get 58. If I subtract 69 and 33, I get -102. If I then add 8 and 14, I get -88 (69 - 33 + 8 + 14 = -88). To get to 58, I need to add 146 (58 + 146 = 200), but 200 is not a result of any combination of the given numbers and operations.
Instead, let's try another combination: 69 - 33 = 36. Now I need 22 more to get to 58. Using the remaining numbers, 8 + 14 = 22. So, 69 - 33 + 8 + 14 = 58.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 33 + 8 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 69, 8, 33, and 14 to get 58. Let's try different combinations of the arithmetic operations:
69 + 33 = 102 (not 58)
69 + 8 + 33 = 110 (too much)
69 - 33 = 36 (not 58)
8 + 14 = 22 (let's keep this, maybe we can use 33 and 69 in a different way)
69 - 33 = 36 (36 + 22 = 58)
So, the equation would be 69 - 33 + 8 + 14 = 58.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 33 + 8 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 82, 36, and 90 that equals 68. Let's look at the numbers we have:
- We can see that 96 + 36 = 132, which is too large.
- If we try 96 - 36 = 60, which is close but still more than 68.
- Let's try operations with 82 and 90: 
  - 90 - 82 = 8. 
  - If we add 96 + 8 we get 104, still too large.
- Another combination: 
  - 96 + (90 - 82) = 96 + 8 = 104, still too large.
- Trying another operation: 
  - 96 - (90 - 82) = 96 - 8 = 88, still too large.
- One last try: 
  - 96 - 82 + 36 = 44 - 82 + 36 = -38 + 36 = -2 - 82 + 36 = -38 + 36 = -2, which is incorrect.
- Finally:
  - 96 - 82 + 36 - 90 = -38 + 36 - 90 = -2 - 90 = -88 + 36 = -52 + 36 = -16, which is still incorrect.
  - Simplified two operations:
  - 96 - (82 - 36) - 90 = 96 - 46 - 90 = 50 - 90 = -40 + 90 = 50 - 40 = 10, which is incorrect.
  - The correct and simplified combination:
  - 96 - 82 + 36 - 90 = -38 + 36 = -2 + 36 = 34 - 90 = -56, which repeats negative numbers.
  - Another correct approach found is:
  - 96 - (82 + 36 - 90) = 96 - (118 - 90) = 96 - 28 = 68.
Thus, the equation using all numbers exactly once is: 96 - (82 + 36 - 90) = 68.
</think>
<answer> 96 - (82 + 36 - 90) </answer>

<think> I need to use the numbers 68, 95, and 73 to make 100. Let's try combining them in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible way is to use the numbers as follows: 95 - 68 + 73
95 - 68 = 27
27 + 73 = 100
So the equation is 95 - 68 + 73 = 100
</think>
<answer> 95 - 68 + 73 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 35 using the numbers 8, 15, 67, and 25 exactly once. Let's try to use basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's see if we can combine any two numbers to get closer to 35:
- 25 + 15 = 40
- 25 + 67 = 92
- 25 + 8 = 33
- 15 + 67 = 82
- 15 + 8 = 23
- 67 + 8 = 75
None of these directly give us 35. Now, let's try combining them with the other number:
- 25 + 15 - 8 = 32
- 25 + 15 - 67 = -27
- 25 + 15 + 8 = 48
- 67 - 25 - 15 = 27
- 67 - 25 + 8 = 50
- 67 - 25 + 15 = 57
It seems combining with 8 or 15 is not getting us to 35. Let's try operations on different pairs:
- 8 * 15 = 120, which is too big.
- 8 * 25 = 200, which is also too big.
- 15 * 25 = 375, which is much too big.
The only operation left to try is 67 - 15 - 8 = 44, which is too big, and 67 - 15 + 8 = 60, which is still too big. The combinations are not working out directly. Revisiting combinations including other numbers:
- 67 - 25 = 42
- Now, perform operations: 42 - 15 = 27, and 27 does not work.
- Considering other operations, 8 - (15 - 25) = 8 - (-10) = 18, and 18 does not work.
- 8 * (25 - 15) = 8 * 10 = 80, too large.
None of the current operations help directly. Trying remaining operations:
- (67 - 15) / 8 = 52 / 8 = 6.5, not an integer.
Rechecking operations:
The correct equation is reevaluation: (67 - 25 - 15) + 8 = 35.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 25 - 15) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 54, 50, and 25 that equals 79. One way to approach this is to consider different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try using the numbers as follows:
54 + 50 - 25 = 79
If we add 54 and 50, we get 104. Then, if we subtract 25 from 104, we get 79.
Therefore, the equation is correct and uses all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 50 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 42, 8, 60, and 35 exactly once to get 75. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, I notice that 60 - 42 = 18, which is somewhat useful. 
Then, 18 + 8 = 26. We're close, but not there yet.
Next, I see that 26 + 35 = 61, still not 75.
Let's try 60 + 8 - 42 = 26, and then 26 + 35 does not get us to 75.
I realize I need to subtract 35 from 60 to get something I can add to 42 and 8 to get 75.
So, 60 - 35 = 25, and 42 + 8 = 50. Combining these gives 50 + 25 = 75.
Thus, the equation is 60 - 35 + 42 + 8 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 35 + 42 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 42, 8, 60, and 35 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
(60 + 42) - 35 = 102 - 35 = 67 (not 75)
60 + 42 - 35 = 102 - 35 = 67 (not 75)
(60 + 42) / 8 = 102 / 8 = 12.75 (not 75)
60 + (42 - 35) = 60 + 7 = 67 (not 75)
42 + (60 - 35) = 42 + 25 = 67 (not 75)
Let's try another approach:
60 + 42 / 8 = 60 + 5.25 (approx.) = 65.25 (not 75)
42 + (60 / 35) = 42 + 1.71 (approx.) = 43.71 (not 75)
We might have missed a combination:
42 + (60 - 35) / 8 = 42 + 25 / 8 = 42 + 3.125 = 45.125 (not 75)
And trying one last time:
(42 + 60) - 35 / 8 = 102 - 4.375 = 97.625 (not 75)
Having tried all the combinations and none work directly, we should re-evaluate:
There was a miscalculation previously due to overlooking one:
60 + (42 / 8) + 35 / 2 is evaluated incorrectly:
42 / 8 = 5.25 and 35 / 2 = 17.5
60 + 5.25 + 17.5 = 82.75 (still not 75)
After many reattempts, it seems a small balancing equation is needed:
( 60 + 8 ) - 35 + 42 = 68 - 35 + 42 = 33 + 42 = 75
</think>
<answer>(60 + 8) - 35 + 42</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 72, 51, and 50 that equals 73. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's consider subtraction:
72 - 51 = 21
21 + 50 = 71
This is close to 73 but not quite there.
Now, let's try adding 50 after subtracting:
72 - 51 + 50 = 71
This is still not 73. Now, let's consider multiplication and division:
50 * 1. 46 = 73
But 1. 46 is not an integer and we can't use it here. So, let's try another approach:
52 - 51 = 1
1 + 72 = 73
But 52 is not in the given numbers. Let's try:
51 - 50 + 72 = 73
This gives us:
51 - 50 = 1
1 + 72 = 73
The equation works! We used 72, 51, and 50 exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 51 - 50 + 72 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 44, 12, and 60 exactly once to get 28. I'll try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One approach is to check if any combination of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations could give 28.
(60 - 44) + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
This satisfies the condition of using each number only once and resulting in 28.
</think>
<answer> (60 - 44) + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 10 using the numbers 40, 45, and 5 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 40 - 45 = -5 (not 10)
- 40 + 45 = 85 (not 10)
- We can try subtraction: 45 - 40 = 5, but we need a number that when added to 5 equals 10. So 5 + 5 = 10.
Thus, the equation would be 45 - 40 + 5 = 10.
</think>
<answer> 45 - 40 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 7, 61, and 56 that equals 35. Let's try different combinations of operations.
- 61 - 7 - 56 = 0 (not 35)
- 61 - 7 + 56 = 110 (not 35)
- 61 + 7 - 56 = 12 (not 35)
- 56 - 7 - 61 = -12 (not 35)
- 56 - 7 + 61 = 110 (not 35)
- 7 + 61 - 56 = 12 (not 35)
- 7 + 56 - 61 = 13 (not 35)
- 61 + 7 - 56 = 12 (not 35)
- 61 + 56 - 7 = 110 (not 35)
- 56 + 7 - 61 = 2 (not 35)
- 7 * 61 / 56 = 8.34375 (not 35)
- 56 * 7 / 61 = 6.45098 (not 35)
- 7 * (61 - 56) = 7 * 5 = 35 (This works)
So the correct equation is 7 * (61 - 56) = 35.
</think>
<answer> 7 * (61 - 56) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 93, 69, 79, and 32 that equals 51. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One combination that comes to mind is subtracting 32 from 79 and then subtracting that result from 93:
79 - 32 = 47
93 - 47 = 46
This is not 51. Let's try another combination:
93 - 79 = 14
Now let's see what we get if we add 14 and 32:
14 + 32 = 46
That's still not 51. Let's try adding 69 to 46:
46 + 69 = 115
That's too high. Let's change the order:
69 + 46 = 115
That still gives 115. Let me try one last combination:
93 - 79 = 14
69 + 14 = 83
That gives 83. I need something else. Let's go back to simpler operations:
93 - 79 = 14
69 - 14 = 55
That's too high. Let me simplify:
79 - (93 - 69) = 79 - 24 = 55
That's too high again. Let me try a different approach:
93 + 69 - 79 - 32 = 93 + 69 - 101 = 22 + 69 - 101 = 91 - 101 = -10
Still not right. Let me try 93 + (79 - 69) = 93 + 10 = 103
Now I am closer, I need to adjust my numbers:
79 - 69 = 10
93 + 10 = 103
That's too high again. Let's try 93 - 69 + 79 - 32 = 24 + 47 = 71
That doesn't work either. Let me simplify the procedure again:
93 + 69 - 79 - 32 = 93 - 79 + 69 - 32 = 14 + 69 - 32 = 83 - 32 = 51
This does indeed equal 51.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 79 + 69 - 32 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 68, 5, and 17 exactly once to make 80. Let's explore the operations:
- Adding 68 and 17 gives 85, which is close but too high.
- Subtracting 17 from 68 gives 51, which is still too high.
- Adding 5 to any of these numbers is unlikely to give 80.
- Let's try multiplying 17 by 5: 17 * 5 = 85, which is close but still too high.
- Now let's try 68 - (17 + 5): this results in 68 - 22 = 46, which is too low.
Let's try 68 + (17 - 5): this results in 68 + 12 = 80.
So the correct equation is 68 + (17 - 5) = 80.
</think>
<answer> 68 + (17 - 5) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation that equals 50 using the numbers 85, 66, 94, and 25 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One way to do this could be:
94 - 85 + 66 + 25 = 50
Let's check if it works:
94 - 85 = 9
9 + 66 = 75
75 + 25 = 100
This is incorrect. Let me try another combination:
94 + 66 - 85 - 25
94 + 66 = 160
160 - 85 = 75
75 - 25 = 50
This combination works. Therefore, the correct equation is 94 + 66 - 85 - 25 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 94 + 66 - 85 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 92, and 6 that equals 83. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's see if I can use any of the numbers in a way that gets close to 83:
92 - 15 = 77
This is close, so let's see if we can adjust it:
92 - 15 + 6 = 83
This gives us the required result of 83.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 15 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 92, and 6 that equals 83. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 92 - 15 + 6
92 - 15 = 77
77 + 6 = 83
This gives us the target number 83. So the equation works.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 15 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 66, 4, and 31 exactly once to create an equation that equals 31. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If I subtract 4 and 31 from 66, I get: 66 - 4 - 31 = 31
This looks like a promising equation. Let's verify:
66 - 4 - 31 = 32 - 31 = 31
The equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 4 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 90, 57, and 51 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One possible combination could be:
90 - 57 + 51
Calculating this:
90 - 57 = 33
33 + 51 = 84
So the equation is 90 - 57 + 51 which indeed equals 84.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 57 + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 90, 57, and 51 exactly once to get 84 as the result. Let's try combining these numbers using different arithmetic operations.
- First, I consider if multiplication or division can help us reach 84. Multiplying the largest two numbers gives us 90 * 57 = 4830, which is far off from 84. Similarly, 90 / 57 gives us approximately 1.587, too small.
- Let's try subtraction and addition: 90 - 57 + 51 = 84. This seems promising because:
  - 90 - 57 = 33
  - Then, 33 + 51 = 84
  So, we used all numbers exactly once and got the result of 84.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 57 + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find an equation that uses the numbers 43, 81, 31, and 58 exactly once to get 11. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, I notice that 58 - 31 = 27, which is close to 11.
Then, if I try to subtract some other number from 27 or add some number to 27, we won't hit 11 easily.
Next, 81 - 43 = 38, which is also not close to 11.
Trying 31 + 43 = 74, doesn't help either.
However, if we consider: 
(81 - 58) - (43 - 31)
This simplifies to:
23 - 12 = 11
So, using these operations on the given numbers, we can create the equation.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 58) - (43 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation that equals 59 using the numbers 63, 47, and 43 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- First, I'll try addition and subtraction:
  (63 + 47) - 43 = 110 - 43 = 67 (not 59)
- Next, let's try:
  63 - (47 - 43) = 63 - 4 = 59 (This seems to work)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 63, 47, and 43 exactly once to get 59 is 63 - (47 - 43).
</think>
<answer> 63 - (47 - 43) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 97, 56, and 56 that equals 97. One way to approach this is to consider if any combination of the numbers and basic operations could achieve the target number.
Let's try an operation that could result in 97:
97 - 56 = 41
This doesn't quite work, as it's 41, not 97.
Next, let's think about whether we can use the 56 more effectively:
(97 + 56) / 56 = 153 / 56 = 2.74 (not an integer, so not exactly 97)
Given the above does not work, let's consider the order of operations:
56 * 56 = 3136
97 - 3136 = -2999
This is not helpful either, as it gives a negative number.
Now, let's think differently with another approach:
(97 + 56) - 56 = 97
In this case, 56 and 56 cancel each other out.
So, we can form the equation:
(97 + 56) - 56 = 97
</think>
<answer> (97 + 56) - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 97, 56, and 56 that equals 97. Let's try combining them in different ways.
One way to approach this could be to look at what operations we can use (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and see if any of these can help us achieve the target number, 97.
If we consider 97 - 56 = 41, we're close but not there yet. Then if we use 97 - (56 - 56) = 97, we're still using the second 56 but removing its negative effect. But we can simplify this further: 97 - 56 + 56 = 97. This gives us our result.
So the equation becomes 97 - 56 + 56 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 56 + 56 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 5, 48, and 36 that equals 89. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One idea is to see if we can use 48 and 36 in a way that adds up to something close to 89 when combined with 5.
48 + 36 = 84
Now, we need 5 more to reach 89, so:
84 + 5 = 89
This combination works. Let's confirm the equation:
5 + 48 + 36 = 89
</think>
<answer> 5 + 48 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 5, 48, and 36 once each to get 89. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 48 - 36 = 12, and then we need 77 more to reach 89, which cannot be achieved with 5.
- 48 - 5 = 43, and then we need 46 more to reach 89, which cannot be achieved with 36.
- 48 + 36 = 84, and then we need 5 more to reach 89, which can be achieved using 5.
So, the equation would be 48 + 36 + 5 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 48 + 36 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 31 using the numbers 70, 33, and 72 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider if there's a combination that can give us a result close to 31. If we look at the numbers, 72 - 70 = 2, which is too small. If we subtract 33 from 70, we get 37, which is too large.
Let's try 72 + 33 - 70. That gives us 75 - 70 = 5, which is still not 31.
Now, let's try a different combination: 72 - (70 - 33). This would be 72 - 7 = 65, which is even further from 31.
Finally, let's try 70 + (33 - 72). This would be 70 + (-39), which equals 31. This works!
So the equation is 70 + (33 - 72) = 31.
</think>
<answer> 70 + (33 - 72) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 55, 44, and 62 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Let's consider all possible combinations:
1. 55 + 44 + 62 = 161 (not 73)
2. 55 + 44 - 62 = 37 (not 73)
3. 55 + 62 - 44 = 73 (this equals 73)
4. 44 + 62 - 55 = 51 (not 73)
5. 62 + 55 - 44 = 73 (this equals 73)
From the combinations above, we see that both 55 + 62 - 44 and 62 + 55 - 44 equal 73. However, since the problem specifies each number should only be used once, the most appropriate equations are 55 + 62 - 44 and 62 + 55 - 44.
</think>
<answer> 55 + 62 - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 55, 44, and 62 that equals 73. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's consider the numbers we have:
55, 44, 62

If I add these numbers together:
55 + 44 + 62 = 161, which is too high.

If I subtract 55 from 62:
62 - 55 = 7, and then adding 44 would be:
7 + 44 = 51, which is still too low.

If I subtract 44 from 62:
62 - 44 = 18, and then adding 55 would be:
18 + 55 = 73, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is 62 - 44 + 55 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 62 - 44 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 2, and 39 that equals 73. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider addition and subtraction. If we add 36 and 39, we get 75, which is close to 73. We can then subtract 2 from 75 to get 73.
The equation would be: (36 + 39) - 2 = 73
</think>
<answer> (36 + 39) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 16, and 60 that equals 80. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 36 + 16 - 60 = 12, which doesn't equal 80
- Multiplying and adding: 36 * 60 + 16 = 2160 + 16 = 2176, which is too large
- Multiplying and subtracting: 60 * 16 - 36 = 960 - 36 = 924, which is also too large
- Using division: (60 - 36) * 16 / 4 = 24 * 16 / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24, not 80
- Another combination: 60 + 36 + 16 = 112, which is too large
- Let's try: 60 + (36 / 16) = 60 + 2.25 = 62.25, not 80
- Finally, let's try: 60 - (36 / 16) = 60 - 2.25 = 57.75, not 80
- Or: 60 + 36 - 16 = 80, this works
After testing these equations, 60 + 36 - 16 equals 80.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 36 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 4, and 60 that equals 19. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible combination is: 60 - 45 - 4
Let's check if this gives us 19:
60 - 45 - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
This does not give us 19. Let's try another combination.
Another combination could be: 60 - 45 + 4
Let's check this:
60 - 45 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19
This combination gives us the desired result of 19.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 45 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 4, and 60 that equals 19. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- 60 - 45 - 4 = 11 (Doesn't work)
- 60 - 45 + 4 = 19 (This works)
Thus, the equation is 60 - 45 + 4 = 19.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 45 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 8, 85, and 47 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- First, let's see if I can use addition and subtraction:
  85 - 8 - 47 = 29 (not 30)
- Next, let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
  8 * 47 + 85 = 386 + 85 = 471 (too high)
  47 * 8 + 85 = 376 + 85 = 461 (too high)
  85 * 8 + 47 = 680 + 47 = 727 (too high)
- Now, let's try a different combination using division:
  85 / 8 + 47 = 10.625 + 47 = 57.625 (not 30)
  47 / 8 + 85 = 5.875 + 85 = 90.875 (too high)
- Finally, let's try:
  (85 - 47) * 8 / 10 = 38 * 8 / 10 = 30.4 (not an integer)
After trying all these combinations, I realize I missed a simple one:
  85 - 47 - 8 = 30
This works as it uses all three numbers exactly once and the correct arithmetic operations.

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 83, 20, and 31 that equals 94. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One way to approach this is to see if the numbers can be combined in a way that using subtraction and addition might work.
Let's try: 83 - 20 + 31
83 - 20 = 63
63 + 31 = 94
This combination gives us the result we need.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 20 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 48, and 70 that equals 97. I'll try different combinations of the operations:
First, let's try adding two of the numbers and then subtracting the third:
21 + 48 - 70 = 79 (not 97)
Next, let's try subtracting two numbers and then adding the third:
70 - 21 - 48 = 2 (not 97)
Now, let's try a different combination:
48 + 70 - 21 = 97 (this works)
So, the equation is 48 + 70 - 21 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 48 + 70 - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 37, and 47 that equals 63. Let's consider different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- If I add 37 and 47, I get 84, which is too high.
- If I subtract 37 from 73, I get 36, which is still not 63.
- If I subtract 47 from 73, I get 26. Now, if I add 37 to 26, I get 63.
Therefore, the equation is 73 - 47 + 37 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 47 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 42, 8, and 3 that equals 53. Let's try different combinations of operations.
(42 - 8) + 3 = 34 + 3 = 37
42 + (8 - 3) = 42 + 5 = 47
42 + 8 - 3 = 46
(42 + 3) - 8 = 45 - 8 = 37
42 - (8 - 3) = 42 - 5 = 37
42 - (8 + 3) is not valid as it will give a number less than 42.
None of the above operations give us 53. It seems I missed a combination.
42 + 8 + 3 = 53
This combination gives us our required number 53.
</think>
<answer> 42 + 8 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to use the numbers 57, 96, 21, and 79 exactly once to get 61. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
One way to approach this is to see if any combination of these numbers with the operations can yield the target.
Consider the expression: 96 - 57 - 21 + 79
96 - 57 = 39
39 - 21 = 18
18 + 79 = 97
This is not 61. So we need to try another combination.
Let's try: 96 - 57 + 21 + 79
96 - 57 = 39
39 + 21 = 60
60 + 79 = 139
This combination is also incorrect.
Another approach could be: 57 + 21 - 96 + 79
57 + 21 = 78
78 - 96 = -18
-18 + 79 = 61
This seems correct. We used each number exactly once and the equation equals 61.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 21 - 96 + 79 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 61 using the numbers 3, 74, 50, and 82 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's see if subtraction and addition can work: 74 - 50 + 82 - 3 doesn't work as it results in 103.
- Then, let's try multiplication and addition: 3 * 74 + 50 + 82 = 222 + 50 + 82 = 354, which is too high.
- Now, let's try a different order: 74 + 82 - 50 - 3 = 156 - 53 = 103, still too high.
- Let's try combining numbers in a new way: (74 - 50) + (82 - 3) = 24 + 79 = 103, which is also too high.
- Let's try: 82 + (74 - 50) - 3 = 82 + 24 - 3 = 103, this is still too high.
- Another trial: 82 + 50 - (74 - 3) = 82 + 50 - 71 = 61, this works!
So the equation that equals 61 is 82 + 50 - (74 - 3) </think>
<answer> 82 + 50 - (74 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 93 using the numbers 87, 3, and 3 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 87 + 3 + 3 = 93 (This combination works)
- Checking if there's any other possibility using different operations, but (87 + 3 + 3) is the only way to get 93 using these numbers.
</think>
<answer> 87 + 3 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 93 using the numbers 87, 3, and 3. One way to approach this is to consider if there's a combination of these numbers that, when combined with basic arithmetic, gives us 93.
Let's try: 87 + 3 + 3
87 + 3 = 90
90 + 3 = 93
This gives us the desired result. So the equation is 87 + 3 + 3.
</think>
<answer> 87 + 3 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 58, and 76 that equals 12. One approach is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 76 - 58 = 18, and then 18 - 30 = -6. That doesn't work.
Next, I'll try: 76 - 58 = 18, and then 18 + 30 = 48. That's still not 12.
Now, let's try: 30 + 58 = 88, and then 88 - 76 = 12. This works!
So the equation is 30 + 58 - 76 = 12.
</think>
<answer> 30 + 58 - 76 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 4, 55, and 10 that equals 41. Let's try different combinations:
- 55 - 4 - 10 = 41
- This combination uses all numbers exactly once and performs a subtraction first (55 - 4 = 51), followed by subtracting 10 (51 - 10 = 41), which equals 41.
This looks correct. So the equation is 55 - 4 - 10 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 55 - 4 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 27, 2, and 34 to make the equation equal to 44. Let's try combining 34 and 27 first: 34 + 27 = 61, which is too high. Now let's try another combination: 34 - 27 = 7, which is too low. Multiplying 34 by 2 gives us 68, which is also too high. Dividing 34 by 2 gives us 17, so now I have 17, 27, and 2. Adding 27 + 17 gives us 44, which is what we want. So the equation is 27 + (34 / 2) = 44.
</think>
<answer> 27 + (34 / 2) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 8, and 68 that equals 15. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Trying to add or subtract these numbers in different combinations doesn't seem to get us close to 15.
- Multiplying 75 by 8 or 68 or dividing any of these by 15 also doesn't work out.
- The only way to get 15 using these numbers is by combining them differently, for instance, using division.
Let's try 75 - 68 - 8. This gives us 75 - 76 = -1, not 15.
Another way could be 75 - 68 + 8, which gives us 75 - 68 + 8 as 75 - 68 = 7, and then 7 + 8 = 15, which is the target result.
Therefore, the equation is 75 - 68 + 8 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 68 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 91, and 48 that equals 55. Let's try combining the numbers in different ways with arithmetic operations.
- First, let's consider the possibility of subtraction. 91 - 48 = 43, and 43 - 12 = 31. This is not 55.
- Next, let's try multiplication and subtraction: 91 * 48 / 12 = 364. This is not 55.
- Now, let's try 91 - 48 + 12: 91 - 48 = 43, and 43 + 12 = 55. This works!
So the equation is 91 - 48 + 12 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 48 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 91, and 48 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 12 + 91 - 48 = 55 (This works! )
- Checking other combinations: 91 - 12 - 48 = 31, 12 + 48 - 91 = -7, 48 - 12 + 91 = 127 (None of these give 55)
So the correct equation is 12 + 91 - 48 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 12 + 91 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 37, 16, 77, and 41 that equals 65. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider whether addition or subtraction could work:
37 + 16 + 77 + 41 = 165 (Not 65)
77 + 41 + 16 - 37 = 192 (Not 65)
Now, let's try multiplication or division:
37 * 77 / 41 + 16 doesn't work out as it exceeds 65.
Let's try another approach: 77 + 41 - 37 - 16 = 77 + 41 - 53 = 65
This combination gives us the correct answer.
</think>
<answer> 77 + 41 - 37 - 16 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 33 using the numbers 67, 24, and 10 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 67 - 24 - 10 = 33
- 67 - 24 + 10 = 53
- 67 + 24 - 10 = 81
- 67 + 24 + 10 = 91
The only combination that works is 67 - 24 - 10 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 24 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 59, 46, and 89 exactly once to get 76 as the result. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 89 - 59 = 30, and then 30 + 46 = 76, which works.
This combination seems correct as it uses all numbers and the equation becomes 89 - 59 + 46 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 59 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 59, 46, and 89 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 59 = 30
- 89 - 46 = 43
- 59 + 46 = 105
- 89 + 46 = 135
None of these straight calculations work. Let's try combining numbers with operations:
- 89 - (59 + 46) = 89 - 105 = -16
- (89 - 59) + 46 = 30 + 46 = 76
We got the right answer, (89 - 59) + 46 = 76.
</think>
<answer>(89 - 59) + 46</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 100 using the numbers 84, 89, and 95. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding 84 and 89 gives 173, and neither further adding nor subtracting 95 gets us to 100.
- Subtracting 84 from 89 gives 5, and adding 95 to this results in 100.
  This works: 89 - 84 + 95 = 100.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 84 + 95 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 83, 16, 86, and 78 that equals 75. Let's try different combinations:
First, notice that if we can make close to 75 by adding or subtracting some of these numbers, we might be able to adjust with multiplication or division to reach exactly 75.
83 + 16 = 99 (too high)
86 - 16 = 70 (too high)
83 + 86 = 169 (too high)
78 + 16 = 94 (too high)
78 + 86 = 164 (too high)
83 + 78 = 161 (too high)
86 + 78 = 164 (too high)
Now, let's try operations:
(86 - 16) + 78 = 70 + 78 = 148 (too high)
(83 - 78) + 16 = 5 + 16 = 21 (too low)
Let's try another approach:
86 + 16 + 78 - 83 = 102 - 83 = 19 (too low)
78 + (86 - 83) = 78 + 3 = 81 (too low)
We need to re-evaluate:
78 + (86 - 83) turns into 78 + 3 = 81 (slightly off)
Let's try:
86 + 83 - 78 - 16 = 169 - 94 = 75
This works! So the equation is:
86 + 83 - 78 - 16 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 86 + 83 - 78 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 1, and 58 that equals 22. Let's explore different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's try multiplication and subtraction: \( 58 \times 1 - 36 = 22 \)
  - This gives us 22, which is exactly what we need.
So, the correct equation is \( 58 \times 1 - 36 = 22 \).
</think>
<answer> 58 * 1 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 56, and 73 that equals 52. I'll try different combinations of the operations.
Let's start with addition and subtraction:
69 + 56 - 73 = 125 - 73 = 52
This works! So the equation is 69 + 56 - 73 = 52.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 56 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 52 using the numbers 69, 56, and 73 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 69 + 56 + 73 = 198 (too high)
- 73 + 56 - 69 = 60 (too high)
- 73 - 56 + 69 = 86 (too high)
- 69 + 73 - 56 = 86 (too high)
- 56 + 69 - 73 = 42 (too low)
- 69 - 73 + 56 = 52 (this works)
So the equation that equals 52 is 69 - 73 + 56.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 73 + 56 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 20, 79, 56, and 50 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's see if we can reach a target close to 65 by adding or subtracting the numbers:
50 + 79 = 129 (too high)
50 + 20 = 70 (too low)
79 - 50 = 29 (not 65)
20 + 56 = 76 (too high)
20 + 50 = 70 (too low)
79 - 20 = 59 (not 65)
Now let's try a combination with multiplication and addition/subtraction:
(79 - 50) * 20 = 29 * 20 = 580 (too high)
(79 - 56) * 20 = 23 * 20 = 460 (too high)
56 + 20 = 76 (too high)
56 + 50 = 106 (too high)
56 + (79 - 50) = 56 + 29 = 85 (too high)
56 + (79 - 20) = 56 + 59 = 115 (too high)
Now we try another combination:
(79 - 56) + 20 + 50 = 23 + 20 + 50 = 93 (too high)
(79 - 5) + 20 + 50 = 74 + 20 + 50 = 144 (too high)
It seems we missed an opportunity. Let's try another approach:
(79 - 50) + 20 + 56 = 29 + 20 + 56 = 105 (too high)
(79 - 56) + 20 + 50 = 23 + 20 + 50 = 93 (too low)
Checking possible additions:
56 + (79 - 20 - 50) = 56 + 9 = 65 (this works)
Thus, the equation is 56 + (79 - 20 - 50) = 65.
</think>
<answer> 56 + (79 - 20 - 50) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 1, 19, 11, and 65 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations and numbers:
(1 + 19 + 11) - 65 = 30 - 65 = -35 (not 34)
(65 - 19) - 11 - 1 = 46 - 11 - 1 = 34
This combination works because 65 - 19 = 46, and then subtracting 11 and 1 from 46 gives us 34.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 19) - 11 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 60, and 79 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
One way to approach this could be to see if any combination of addition and subtraction of these numbers can give us 55.
Let's try: 79 - 60 + 36. This gives us 15 + 36 = 51, which is not 55.
Let's try another combination: 79 - 60 - 36. This gives us 19 - 36 = -17, which is not 55.
Now let's try: 79 + 60 - 36. This gives us 139 - 36 = 103, which is not 55.
It seems none of these simple combinations work. Let's try something else: 79 - (60 + 36). This gives 79 - 96 = -17, which is not 55.
No luck. Let's consider: 79 - 60 + (36 / 3). Here, 36 / 3 = 12, so 79 - 60 + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41, which is still not 55.
We can try: (79 + 60) / 36. This gives us 139 / 36 which is approximately 3.86, not 55 either.
Looking again, we can try: 79 - 60 * 36 / 100. Actually, this will mean 60 * 0. 036 =1. 048, and the equation will be 79 - 1. 048. This approximation gets closer but needs exact values. By manual reassessment, earlier we missed considering: (79 - 60) * 36 / 100 gives 19 * 0. 36 which equals 7. 04. This close.
The only precise logic fits: 79 + 60 - 36 = 139 - 36 = 103 isn't exact. Critical logic likely was neglected as, 79, 60, and 36 fractions/arithmetic handling gave 55 directly: (79 - 60) + 36. That is, (79 - 60) = 19, and 19 + 36 = 55.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 60) + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 60, and 79 that equals 55. Let's try combining them in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to do this is:
79 - 60 + 36 = 55
Let's verify:
First, 60 - 79 = -19. Then, -19 + 79 = 60. And finally, 60 + 36 = 96, which is incorrect.
Let's try another combination:
36 + 60 - 79 = 55
Now, let's verify:
First, 36 + 60 = 96. Then, 96 - 79 = 17, which is also incorrect.
It seems the first combination was indeed correct upon re-checking:
79 - 60 + 36 = 55
</think>
<answer> 79 - 60 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 57, 14, and 27 exactly once, with each number used only once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, consider the possibility of addition and subtraction:
57 + 14 + 27 = 98 (but this uses all the numbers)
57 + 27 - 14 = 70 (this is too low)
14 + 27 + 57 = 98 (this uses all the numbers)
14 + 57 - 27 = 44 (this is too low)
27 + 57 - 14 = 70 (this is too high)
From this, we see that 57 + 27 + 14 = 98 works, but we need to use all three numbers in a single equation.
Now consider multiplication and addition/subtraction:
57 * 14 - 27 = 798 - 27 = 771 (this is too high)
57 * (14 - 27) = 57 * (-13) = -741 (this is too low)
27 * 14 + 57 = 378 + 57 = 435 (this is too low)
From these calculations, the only valid combination is:
57 + 27 + 14 = 98
But I need to use just one equation.
Another try, considering different combinations and operations:
57 - (27 * 14 / 100) is not realizable with 100 because 14 and 27 can't be manipulated together to make 100.
So, finally, it seems:
57 + 27 + 14 = 98
However, if we converge on a valid simplified step:
57 * 14 - 27 = 798 - 27 = 771 (not valid)
57 + (14 - 27) is negative, or fractional operations incorrect for exact.
Rather:
57 + 27 + 14 = 98 works.
The classical, correct format:
(57 + 27) + 14 = 98
</think>
<answer>(57 + 27) + 14</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 37, 37, and 14 that equals 15. I can use basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's add 37 and 14: 37 + 14 = 51
Now, I need a way to get from 51 to 15. I can do this by subtracting 37 from 51: 51 - 37 = 14. Then, I need to subtract one more 37 to get to 15, but since I can't double use 37, I'll try different combinations.
Instead, let's try another approach: 37 - 37 + 14 = 0 + 14 = 14. This is close but not what I need. Another try:
(37 + 14) / 37 = 51 / 37, which is not an integer. Now, let's try:
(37 - 14) / 37 = 23 / 37, also not equal to 15. Testing another could be:
37 / 37 + 14 is 1 + 14 = 15. This works!
So the correct equation is 37 / 37 + 14 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 37 / 37 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 27, 65, and 54 that equals 63. I'll try different combinations of the basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the numbers as they are:
27 + 65 + 54 = 146 (which is not 63)
27 + 65 - 54 = 42 (which is not 63)
27 + 54 - 65 = 16 (which is not 63)
65 + 54 - 27 = 92 (which is not 63)
Now, let's try multiplication or division:
27 * 65 / 54 is not an integer
Working with division and 54:
(65 - 27) / 54 = 38 / 54 is not 63
Multiplying:
54 * 27 / 65 is not 63
Considering 65 - (54 / 27):
65 - (54 / 27) is approximately 65 - 2 = 63
Now let's verify:
65 - 54 / 27 = 65 - 2 = 63
This matches our target.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 62 using the numbers 78, 50, 24, and 58 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 78 - 50 - 24 + 58 = 062
- 78 - 50 + 24 + 58 = 108 (too high)
- 78 + 50 - 24 - 58 = 56 (too low)
- 78 + 50 + 24 - 58 = 192 (too high)
- 78 + 50 - 24 + 58 = 162 (too high)
- 78 + 50 - 58 + 24 = 194 (too high)
From these calculations, it's clear that 78 - 50 - 24 + 58 equals 62. This is the correct combination.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 50 - 24 + 58 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 78, 50, 24, and 58 that equals 62. I'll manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's try different combinations:
- 78 - 50 = 28
- 28 + 24 = 52
- 52 + 58 = 110 (too big)
- 78 - 24 = 54
- 54 - 50 = 4 (too small)
Now, let's try another combination:
- 78 + 24 = 102
- 102 - 50 = 52
- 52 - 58 = -6 (too small)
Let's try 58 in a different place:
- 78 + 50 = 128
- 128 - 24 = 104
- 104 - 58 = 46 (too big)
Finally, I get 78 + 50 - 58 + 24 = 134 - 58 + 24 = 76 - 58 = 18 (still too big)
Hmm, none of these worked. Let's recall other combinations:
- 78 + 50 = 128
- 128 - 24 = 104
- 104 - 58 = 46 (too big)
Let's test this combination again:
- 58 + 24 = 82 (not needed in this solution)
- 78 + 50 = 128
- 128 - 58 = 70 (still too big)
- 78 + 50 - 58 - 24 = 128 - 82  (This simplifies down in different ways)
Let's simplify:
58 + (78 - 50) = 58 + 28 = 86 (too big)
Next, I found:
58 + 78 - 50 - 24 = 134 - 74 = 60 (still just over)
Next I try
78 + 50 - 58 + 24 = 128 - 58 + 24 = 70 - 34 = 36 (too small)
Now let's finish this other simplification:
58 + 78 - (50 + 24) = 136 - 74 = 62 **Found it!**
</think>
<answer> 58 + 78 - 50 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 4, and 49 that equals 37. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction: 
  49 + 3 - 4 = 48 (which is close, but not 37)
- Next, let's try 49 - (3 + 4):
  49 - (3 + 4) = 49 - 7 = 42 (still not 37)
- Now, let's try 49 + 3 * 4:
  49 + 3 * 4 = 49 + 12 = 61 (too high)
- It seems like 49 - (3 + 4) is too low, and 49 + 3 * 4 is too high, so let's look at another combination.
- Let's try 49 - 3 + 4:
  49 - 3 + 4 = 46 + 4 = 50 (not correct)
- Since none of those combinations worked, let's try 3 * (4 + 49):
  3 * (4 + 49) = 3 * 53 = 159 (not 37)
It seems like the direct calculation approach isn't working. However, let's consider if we can use any of the numbers in a different way, specifically involving the order of operations:
- Considering 49 can be manipulated within the constraints:
  49 - (3 * 4) = 49 - 12 = 37
This calculation now gives us the required result.
</think>
<answer> 49 - (3 * 4) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 67, and 54 that equals 99. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
22 + 67 + 54 = 143 (too high)
67 + 54 - 22 = 99 (this could work)
22 + 54 + 67 = 143 (too high)
67 - 54 + 22 = 35 (too low)
Therefore, the correct equation is 67 + 54 - 22 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 67 + 54 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 81, 1, 47, and 45 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination is: 81 - 47 + 1 + 45
Calculating this:
81 - 47 = 34
34 + 1 = 35
35 + 45 = 80
This doesn't give us 84. Let me try another combination:
81 + 45 - 47 + 1
Calculating this:
81 + 45 = 126
126 - 47 = 79
79 + 1 = 80
This still doesn't work. Let's try:
45 + 81 + 1 - 47
Calculating this:
45 + 81 = 126
126 + 1 = 127
127 - 47 = 80
None of these combinations work either. Let’s try:
45 + 47 + 81 - 1
Calculating this:
45 + 47 = 92
92 + 81 = 173
173 - 1 = 172
This is too high. Given the numbers, I can conclude that:
The closest equation that can be formed is: 81 + 45 + 1 - 47 = 80
But the target is 84, so it seems I need an additional 4 to match. However, since we're limited to using each number only once and standard arithmetic, there might be an oversight or need for reevaluation in standard rules - let's check for combinations by breadth.
Looking agin, I see:
(One of these which correctly on oversight):
47 + 81 - 45 - 1 remaining follows perfectly:
47 + 81 = 128
128 - 45 = 83
83 - 1 = 82, I expected 84
Then possible a few minor errors within standard arithmetic, in this order:
47 + 81 - 45 + 1 too close gives 84.
After manually verifying, the equation to get 84 is: 
47 + 81 + 1 - 45
47 + 81 = 128
128 + 1 = 129
129 - 45 = 84
</think>
<answer> 47 + 81 + 1 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 90, 19, and 73 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One way could be: 90 - 19 - 73
This gives: 90 - 19 = 71
Then, 71 - 73 = -2
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
90 - (19 + 73)
First, 19 + 73 = 92
Then, 90 - 92 = -2
This also doesn't work. Let's try:
73 + 19 - 90
Here, 73 + 19 = 92
Then, 92 - 90 = 2
This still doesn't work. We need to try:
(90 - 73) + 19
First, 90 - 73 = 17
Then, 17 + 19 = 36
This fits! The equation is (90 - 73) + 19.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 73) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 90, 19, and 73 that equals 36. Let's try different combinations of operations:
90 - 73 = 17
17 + 19 = 36
This shows that we can use the operations subtraction and addition.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 73 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 90, 19, and 73 exactly once, I need to consider different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to see if any combination of these numbers could naturally add up to 36 when combined through addition or subtraction. Here's the consideration:
90 + 19 + 73 = 182 (which is too large)
73 + 19 + 90 = 182 (also too large)
90 + 19 - 73 = 40 (still too large)
90 - 73 + 19 = 36 (this gives the desired result 36)
So the equation that works is 90 - 73 + 19 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 73 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to use the numbers 66, 60, 81, and 15 exactly once to get 30. Let's try different combinations:
- Starting with simple additions and subtractions:
  81 + 60 - 66 - 15 = 87 - 81 = 6
  This isn't right.
- Let's try different pairings:
  (81 - 66) + (60 - 15) = 15 + 45 = 60
  This isn't 30 either.
- Now, let's try multiplying 66 and 15 to get 990 and subtracting from 81 + 60:
  990 - (81 + 15) = 990 - 96 = 890
  Still not 30.
- Let's try another combination:
  (66 + 15) - 60 + 81 = 81 - 60 + 81 = 21 + 81 = 102
  This is also not right.
- After some consideration, I find it useful to test a different setup:
  66 - (81 - 15) + 60 = 66 - 66 + 60 = 0 + 60 = 60
  Not correct yet.
- Finally, if I re-examine:
  (60 + 15) - 81 + 66 = 75 - 81 + 66 = -6 + 66 = 60
  Not 30 either.
- Now I try:
  (81 + 15) - (66 + 60) = 96 - 126 = -30
  This is close but negative.
- Lastly, I try:
  (81 - 66) + (60 - 15) = 15 + 45 = 60
  This equals 60, not 30.
- Obviously, nothing seems to work perfectly directly. Let me try:
  66 - 81 + (60 - 15) = -15 + 45 = 30
  This satisfies the condition. It does.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 81 + (60 - 15) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 16, and 43 that equals 44. I'll try different combinations of operations.
One way to approach this is to look for numbers that can be combined directly or through simple operations.
If I add 17 and 16, I get 33. Then, adding 11 to 33 would give 44. However, 11 is not one of our numbers.
Instead, I can try 17 + 43 = 60. Then, subtracting 16 from 60 gives 44. This works!
So, the equation is 17 + 43 - 16 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 17 + 43 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 4, and 90 that equals 84. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One possible combination is to use subtraction: 90 - 69 - 4. This would give us 90 - 69 = 21, and then 21 - 4 = 17. That doesn't work.
Another combination could be multiplication, subtraction, then addition: (90 - 69) * 4. This becomes 21 * 4 = 84. This seems to work.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 69) * 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 4, and 90 that equals 84. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider addition and subtraction:
69 + 4 + 90 = 163 (not 84)
69 + 90 - 4 = 155 (not 84)
Then, let's try multiplication and addition:
69 * 4 + 90 = 316 (not 84)
69 * 90 + 4 = 6214 (not 84)
Let's try another combination:
4 * 90 - 69 = 240 - 69 = 171 (not 84)
Lastly, let's try:
90 - 69 + 4 = 24 (Not 84)
It seems none of the straightforward combinations worked. Let’s try mixing:
4 * (90 - 69) = 4 * 21 = 84
This combination gives us our target number.
So, the equation is 4 * (90 - 69) = 84.
</think>
<answer> 4 * (90 - 69) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 80, 60, 1, and 55 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- Using 80 + 60 + 1 + 55: This equals 196, which is too large.
- Using 60 - 55 + 80 + 1: This equals 106, which is also too large.
- Using 60 + 55 - 1 - 80: This equals 34, which is our target.
So, the correct equation is 60 + 55 - 1 - 80 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 55 - 1 - 80 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 41, 79, and 56 that equals 94. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- First, let's see if we can add or subtract the numbers close to 94:
  - 79 + 56 - 41 = 94 (This combination works)
- Another way to verify:
  - 41 + 56 - 79 = 22 (Doesn't work)
- Or:
  - 41 + 79 - 56 = 64 (Doesn't work)
So, the correct equation is 79 + 56 - 41 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 79 + 56 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 23, 7, and 97 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible approach could be: (97 - 23) - 7
(97 - 23) - 7 = 74 - 7 = 67
This is close but not 81. Another approach could be using division or multiplication:
97 - (23 + 7) = 97 - 30 = 67
Again, not 81. Let me try another combination:
(97 - 7) - 23 = 90 - 23 = 67
Still not 81. Let's try this one:
23 + (97 - 7) = 23 + 90 = 113
This is too high. Let's try this one last time:
97 + (23 - 7) = 97 + 16 = 113
Finally, I see another possibility:
97 - 23 - 7 = 70 - 7 = 63
This is very close, but not 81. Let’s go back to an original idea creatively:
I'll try this:
97 - (23 / 7) = 97 - 3.2857 (not an integer and not 81)
I will try this:
97 - 23 + 7 = 74 + 7 = 81
Therefore, the equation that equals 81 is 97 - 23 + 7.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 23 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 91, and 85 that equals 69. Let's consider all possible combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 91 - 75 = 16 (doesn't work)
- 91 - 85 = 6 (doesn't work)
- 91 + 85 = 176 (doesn't work)
- 75 + 91 = 166 (doesn't work)
- 85 - 75 = 10 (doesn't work)
- 75 + 85 - 91 = 69 (this works)
Therefore, the equation is 75 + 85 - 91 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 85 - 91 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 16, 11, and 57 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
One possible combination is: 57 + 16 - 11
Let's calculate it:
57 + 16 = 73
73 - 11 = 62
This does not equal 84.
Let's try another combination: 57 + 11 - 16
Let's calculate it:
57 + 11 = 68
68 - 16 = 52
This also does not equal 84.
Another combination could be: 57 - 11 + 16
Let's calculate it:
57 - 11 = 46
46 + 16 = 62
This does not equal 84 either.
Finally, let's try: 57 + (16 - 11)
Let's calculate it:
16 - 11 = 5
57 + 5 = 62
This is not 84.
It seems none of the simple combinations work. Well, let's go through another check:
57 + (16 - 11) = 62 (as calculated before)
Another possible check: (57 - 11) + 16
57 - 11 = 46
46 + 16 = 62
Nothing seems right. Rechecking calculation redundantly confirms the only path objectively provides:
57 + (16 - 11) = 62
We have to conclude 62 cannot equate to 84.
Thus, a new way is needed: let's re-check.
Lastly solving correctly:
57 + 16 - 11 = 62
57 + (16 - 11) = 62 
None fit 84: re-check algebraic arrangement fitting equals directly directly 84, found it.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 16 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 7, 56, and 37 exactly once to make 100. Let's consider different combinations of the operations:
One possibility is using the numbers in the form of (a * b) + c or similar expressions.
Looking at 56 and 37, if we add them: 56 + 37 = 93, which is pretty close to 100.
If we then take 7 and use the operation with this, to get to 100:
56 + 37 + 7 = 100.
Thus, the equation is 56 + 37 + 7 = 100.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 37 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 35, 96, and 21 exactly once to get 82. Let's try different combinations of operations:
We can try adding and subtracting:
35 + 96 - 21 = 111 - 21 = 90
This isn't 82, so let's try another combination.
Let's try a different order:
96 - 35 + 21 = 61 + 21 = 82
This gives us the result we need. So the equation is 96 - 35 + 21 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 35 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 14, 83, and 49 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations:
- 83 - 49 - 14 = 20
- 83 - 49 + 14 = 50
- 83 + 49 - 14 = 118
- 83 + 14 - 49 = 48
From the above, we can see that 83 + 14 - 49 equals 48.
</think>
<answer> 83 + 14 - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 51, 37, and 48 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One possible combination is: 51 - 37 + 48
51 - 37 equals 14
Then, 14 + 48 equals 62
This is close, but not 34. Let's try another combination: 51 - (37 + 48)
37 + 48 equals 85
Then, 51 - 85 equals -34
This is 34 but in the negative. We need the positive 34. Let's try: 48 - (37 - 51)
37 - 51 equals -14
Then, 48 - (-14) equals 48 + 14 = 62
This is too large. Finally, let's try: 51 + 48 - 37
51 + 48 equals 99
Then, 99 - 37 equals 62
This is not 34. Now, let's try: 37 - (51 - 48)
51 - 48 equals 3
Then, 37 - 3 equals 34
So the equation that works is 37 - (51 - 48) = 34.
</think>
<answer> 37 - (51 - 48) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 93, 9, 90, and 60 that equals 54. I should try different combinations of the given arithmetic operations.
One possible combination is using subtraction and division:
93 - 90 = 3
Then, 3 / 9 = 0.3333
This doesn't work, so let's try another:
(93 - 90) / 9 = 3 / 9 = 0.3333
This also doesn't work. Let's try a different approach:
93 - (90 / 60) = 93 - 1.5 = 91.5
This also doesn't work. Let's use a different arrangement:
(93 - 90) * 60 = 3 * 60 = 180
This also doesn't work. Now let's try:
93 - 90 / 60 = 93 - 1.5 = 91.5
This also doesn't work. Let's try:
93 - 9 - 90 / 60 = 93 - 9 - 1.5 = 82.5
This also doesn't work. The only combination that works is:
93 - 90 + 9 - 60 = 3 - 60 = -57
Finally, one correct equation I missed is:
(93 - 90 + 9) / 60 = 3 / 60 = 0.05
Correct equation should be based on:
93 - (90 - 60) = 93 - 30 = 63
Not matching 54. Let me try:
93 - (9 * (90 - 60)) / 60 = 93 - (9 * 30) / 60 = 93 - 270 / 60 = 93 - 4.5 = 88.5
Finally:
93 + 9 - 90 - 60 = 102 - 150 = -48
I can use:
93 - 90 - 9 + 60 = 24 - 9 = 15
Correct form equation:
(93 - 90) + 9 - 60 = 3 + 9 - 60 = -48
Perhaps wrong, let me check:
93 - 90 + 9 - 60 = 3 - 51 = -48
Correct form equation:
93 - 90 + 9 - 60 = -48
Finally correct step:
93 - (90 - 60) = 93 - 30 = 63
I need 54, checking:
(93 - 90 + 9) / 60 = 12 / 60 = 0.20
Correct:
(93 - 90 + 9) / 60 = 12 / 60 = 0.20
Correct step equation solving 54 is:
93 - 90 + 9 - 60 = -48
Let equation:
93 - 9 - 90 + 60 = 54
</think>
<answer> 93 - 9 - 90 + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 56, 49, and 88 that equals 95. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's see if we can use multiplication or division to get closer to 95:
- Trying 88 * 1.125 is close to 95, but 1.125 is not an integer or one of the numbers we have.
Now, let's try addition and subtraction:
- 56 + 49 = 105 (too high)
- 56 + 88 = 144 (too high)
- 88 + 49 = 137 (too high)
- 88 - 49 = 39 (too low)
- 49 - 56 = -7 (too low)
Let's try the numbers in different orders:
- 88 + 49 - 56 = 81 (too low)
- 88 + 56 - 49 = 95 (this works!)
So the equation is 88 + 56 - 49 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 88 + 56 - 49 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 62, 90, and 70 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 90 + 70 = 160 (which is too high)
- 90 + 62 = 152 (which is also too high)
- 90 - 62 = 28 (which is too low)
- 90 - 70 = 20 (which is too low)
- 90 * 62 = 5580 (which is way too high)
- 70 * 62 = 4340 (which is also way too high)
- 90 / 62 = 1.4516 (which is not an integer and not helpful)
- 70 / 62 = 1.129 (which is not an integer and not helpful)
- 62 + 90 = 152 (which is too high)
- 62 + 70 = 132 (which is too high)
- 90 - 62 + 70 = 98 (works! )
So the correct equation is 90 - 62 + 70 = 98.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 82 using the numbers 80, 40, and 20 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers.
Let's try: 80 - 40 + 20
80 - 40 = 40
40 + 20 = 60
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
Let's try: 80 + (40 / 20)
80 + (40 / 20) = 80 + 2 = 82
This combination works.
</think>
<answer> 80 + (40 / 20) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 95 using the numbers 40, 33, 18, and 70 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 70 + 33 + 18 + 40 = 161 (too high)
- 70 + 40 + 33 + 18 = 161 (too high)
- 70 + 40 + 18 + 33 = 161 (too high)
- 70 + 33 + 18 - 40 = 69 (too low)
- 70 + 33 - 18 + 40 = 125 (too high)
- 70 - 33 + 40 + 18 = 95 (this works)
So the equation that equals 95 is 70 - 33 + 40 + 18.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 33 + 40 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 79, 73, and 87 that equals 65. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's consider the numbers 87 and 79:
87 + 79 = 166
This is too large, so let's try subtraction:
87 - 79 = 8
Now we need to use 73 to get to 65. Adding 73 to our result:
8 + 73 = 81
This is still not 65, so let's try:
79 - 73 = 6
Now, using 87 to reach 65:
67 - 87 = -22
This doesn't work. Let's try rearranging the order and operations:
(87 - 73) + 79 = 54 + 79 = 133
Still not 65. Let's try:
(79 - 87) + 73
This gives -8 + 73 = 65
This works, but let's confirm by calculating in a clear order:
(79 - 87) + 73 = 65.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 87) + 73 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find an equation using the numbers 77, 13, and 30 that equals 60. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
First, let's try adding some numbers and subtracting others:
77 + 13 + 30 = 120 (This is too high)
77 + 30 - 13 = 94 (This is also too high)
Now, let's try subtracting and adding in a different way:
77 - 30 - 13 = 34 (This is too low)
Let's try another combination:
30 + 13 + 77 = 120 (This is too high again)
I notice that adding 77 and then adding 13 results in 90, which is close but not 60. Subtracting 13 from 77 first will bring me closer to 60:
77 - 13 = 64
Now I have 64, and I need to make it 60. To do this, I can subtract another 4, but 4 is not one of the numbers I have. 
30 - 10 = 20 (closest I can get with 30 and numbers only)
However, 20 is still too high - I need to subtract more numbers to get to 60. Let's try a different combination:
77 - 30 = 47 (removing 13)
Then adding 13: 47 + 13 = 60
This seems likely but let's make sure no other option is better:
No others fit better.
This final equation is 77 - 30 + 13 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 30 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 63, 70, and 35 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
63 + 70 + 35 = 168 (which is too high)
70 + 35 - 63 = 42 (which is too low)
63 + 70 - 35 = 98 (this looks promising)
So the correct equation is 63 + 70 - 35 = 98.
</think>
<answer> 63 + 70 - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 99, and 89 that equals 63. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 99 - 89 = 10
- 10 + 73 = 83 (This is not 63)
- 99 - (73 + 89) = 99 - 162 = -63 (This is close but in the wrong direction)
- 99 - (89 - 73) = 99 - 16 = 83 (Still not 63)
- 73 + (99 - 89) = 73 + 10 = 83 (Still not 63)
It seems combination are not fitting yet. Let's try different order or operations.
- 89 - 73 = 16
- 99 - 16 = 83 (Still not 63)
- Now see we need 73 - (99 - 89) = 73 - 10 = 63!
Alright, so 89 - (99 - 73) results in our target number 63.
</think>
<answer> 89 - (99 - 73) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 63 using the numbers 73, 99, and 89 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One approach is to check if any combination of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division gives 63.
(99 - 89) + 73 = 0 + 73 = 73
73 + (99 - 89) = 73 + 0 = 73
Neither of these give 63.
Let's try another combination:
99 - 89 + 73 = 10 + 73 = 83
73 + 89 - 99 = 152 - 99 = 53
Still not 63.
Let's try one more combination which seemed promising:
73 + 89 - 99 = 162 - 99 = 63
It works! 73 + 89 - 99 equals 63.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 89 - 99 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 67, 64, and 48 that equals 83. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 67 + 64 + 48 = 179 (This is too high)
- 67 + 64 - 48 = 83 (This looks promising, as it equals 83)
So, the equation 67 + 64 - 48 equals 83.
</think>
<answer> 67 + 64 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 83 using the numbers 67, 64, and 48 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- I know that 67 + 16 = 83, but 16 isn't one of our numbers.
- 64 + 19 = 83, but 19 isn't one of our numbers either.
- If I try 67 + 64 - 48 = 83, this gives the correct result. So the equation seems to be 67 + 64 - 48 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 67 + 64 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 22, 9, 71, and 4 to make 88. Let's try different combinations:
(71 - 22) + 9 + 4 = 50 + 9 + 4 = 64 (too low)
(71 - 22) + 9 + 4 = 50 + 13 = 63 (still too low)
Let's try another order:
(71 + 22) - 9 + 4 = 93 - 9 + 4 = 84 (still a bit high)
Let's try:
71 + (22 - 9) + 4 = 71 + 13 + 4 = 88 (this works)
So, the equation that equals 88 is 71 + (22 - 9) + 4.
</think>
<answer> 71 + (22 - 9) + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 88 using the numbers 22, 9, 71, and 4 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One potential combination is: 71 + 22 - 9 - 4
71 + 22 = 93
93 - 9 = 84
84 - 4 = 80
This is close but not 88. Let's try another: 71 + 22 - (9 - 4)
71 + 22 = 93
93 - 5 = 88
This works because (9 - 4) = 5.
</think>
<answer> 71 + 22 - (9 - 4) </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 47 using the numbers 55, 79, and 23 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 79 - 55 = 24 (not 47)
- 79 - 23 = 56 (not 47)
- 79 + 55 = 134 (not 47)
- 55 + 23 = 78 (not 47)
- 79 + 23 - 55 = 47 (this equals 47)
So the equation is 79 + 23 - 55 = 47.
</think>
<answer> 79 + 23 - 55 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 47 using the numbers 55, 79, and 23 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- 79 - 55 = 24 (too low)
- 79 - 23 = 56 (too high)
- 55 + 23 = 78 (too high)
- 79 + 23 = 102 (too high)
- 55 + 79 = 134 (too high)
- 79 - 55 + 23 = 47 (this looks promising)
So the equation is 79 - 55 + 23 = 47.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 55 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 79 using the numbers 80, 10, and 9 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- 80 - 10 - 9 = 61 (too high)
- 80 - 10 + 9 = 79 (this looks promising)
- 80 + 10 - 9 = 81 (too high)
- 80 + 10 + 9 = 99 (too high)
The combination 80 - 10 + 9 equals 79, which is our target number. So the equation is 80 - 10 + 9.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 10 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 77 using the numbers 53, 37, and 93 exactly once. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's see if subtracting and adding can lead to 77.
- 93 - 53 = 40
- Now we need 37 + 40 = 77
So the equation using the numbers 53, 37, and 93 is 93 - 53 + 37 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 53 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 19, 37, and 18 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 37 - 19 = 18, and 18 is one of the numbers, so let's try variations with 18.
- 37 - 19 + 18 = 36
This combination satisfies the condition. Therefore, the equation is 37 - 19 + 18 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 37 - 19 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 79 using the numbers 69, 84, 50, and 24 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 84 - 69 = 15
- 50 - 24 = 26
- Adding or subtracting these results from the remaining numbers doesn't seem to get me close to 79.
- Let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
- 84 * 2 = 168 (which is too high)
- 69 * 2 = 138 (which is also too high)
- 84 + 50 + 24 = 168 (which is too high)
- 84 + 50 - 24 = 110 (which is too high)
- 84 - (69 + 24) = 84 - 93 = -9 (which is too low)
- 69 + 50 - 24 = 95 - 24 = 71 (which is close but not exact)
- Now try a different combination: 84 + 50 - 69 - 24 = 134 - 93 = 41
It seems I need to rethink my approach. Let's try again:
- 84 + 50 - 24 = 110
- 110 - 69 = 41 (still not 79)
- Let's try 84 + 69 - 50 - 24 = 153 - 74 = 79
This combination seems to work: 84 + 69 - 50 - 24 = 79 </think>
<answer> 84 + 69 - 50 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 69, 84, 50, and 24 exactly once to get 79. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible way could be: 84 - 69 + 50 - 24
84 - 69 = 15
15 + 50 = 65
65 - 24 = 41
But this doesn't give 79.
Let's try another approach: 84 + 50 - 69 - 24
84 + 50 = 134
134 - 69 = 65
65 - 24 = 41
This also doesn't work.
Let me try: 84 - 50 + 69 - 24
84 - 50 = 34
34 + 69 = 103
103 - 24 = 79
This gives the right result.
So the equation is 84 - 50 + 69 - 24 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 50 + 69 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 5, and 76 that equals 91. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- If I use multiplication first: (3 * 5) + 76 = 15 + 76 = 91 (This works)
- Another way to check: 3 * (5 + 76) = 3 * 81 = 243 (This doesn't work)
So, the equation that works is (3 * 5) + 76 = 91.
</think>
<answer> (3 * 5) + 76 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 45 using the numbers 88, 38, and 95 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations.
(95 + 38) - 88 = 133 - 88 = 45
So the equation that works is (95 + 38) - 88 = 45.
</think>
<answer> (95 + 38) - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 55 using the numbers 90, 31, and 66 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 90 - 31 - 66 = 13 (not 55)
- 90 - 31 + 66 = 125 (not 55)
- 90 + 31 - 66 = 55 (this could be our answer)
So, 90 + 31 - 66 equals 55. This satisfies the condition of using each number only once and resulting in 55.
</think>
<answer> 90 + 31 - 66 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 53, 34, and 71 exactly once. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's add 53 and 34: 53 + 34 = 87
- Now we have 87 and 71. If we subtract 71 from 87: 87 - 71 = 16
- We are one number short of 90, so let's add 71 to the 16 we just got: 71 + 16 = 87, but we need to get to 90, so this isn't correct yet.
- Instead, let's try another combination: 71 + (53 - 34) = 71 + 19 = 90
This combination gives us the correct result of 90.
</think>
<answer> 71 + (53 - 34) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 51, 9, and 31 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 51 + 9 + 31 = 91 (not 73)
- 51 + 9 - 31 = 29 (not 73)
- 51 + 31 - 9 = 73 (this looks promising)
- 51 - 9 + 31 = 73 (also works)
Now I have two potential solutions: 51 + 31 - 9 = 73 or 51 - 9 + 31 = 73. Both are correct.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 31 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 51, 9, and 31 exactly once. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's see if there's a combination that, when added or subtracted, gets us close to 73.
- Adding 51 and 31 gives us 82, which is close but above 73.
- Subtracting 31 from 51 gives us 20, and then adding 9 to 20 gives us 29, which is far from 73.
- Now let's try: 51 - 31 + 9 = 29 (which isn't 73).
- Let's try another combination: 31 + 51 - 9 = 73.
This combination works as it gives us 73.
</think>
<answer> 31 + 51 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 30, 35, 36, and 47 exactly once to get 76. Let's try different combinations:
First, I notice that 36 + 40 = 76, but 40 is not available. Next, 35 + 41 = 76, but 41 is not available. 
30 + 46 = 76 but 46 is not available.
30 + 36 + 10 = 76, but 10 is not available.
30 + 35 + 41 = 106, but 41 is not available.
Now, let's try 36 + 35 + 4 + 5 = 80, which is close but not quite 76.
36 + 35 - 1 = 70, which is still far from 76.
Then I consider:
36 + 35 + 47 - 30 = 108 - 30 = 78, which is close but still too high.
36 + 35 - 47 + 30 = 71, which is also not 76.
Now I consider the reverse order and specific grouping:
36 + (35 - 30) + 47 = 36 + 5 + 47 = 88 which is too high.
36 + (35 + 30) - 47 = 36 + 65 - 47 = 55 which is also not 76.
Finally, one more combination:  
36 + (47 - 35) + 30 = 36 + 12 + 30 = 78, which is higher.
Trying all other plausible combinations:
35 + (36 - 30) + 47 = 35 + 6 + 47 = 88 too high.
35 + (47 - 30) + 36 = 35 + 17 + 36 = 88 too high.
Just one last group.
Lastly consider: 
30 + 36 + (47 - 35) = 30 + 36 + 12 = 78 not right.
All the computations lead to 76 we got only:
30 + 35 + 47 - 36; converting, (30 + 35 + 47 - 36) = 76.

- First, I'll consider multiplication and addition/subtraction: 90 - 60 + 6 = 36 (not 100)
- Then, let's try 90 + 60 - 6: 90 + 60 = 150, then 150 - 60 = 90 (not 100)
- Now, let's try 90 + 60 / 6: 60 / 6 = 10, then 90 + 10 = 100
This shows that 90 + (60 / 6) equals 100.
</think>
<answer> 90 + 60 / 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 100 using the numbers 6, 90, and 60 exactly once. One way to approach this is to consider the operations and how they can combine these numbers.
Let's try different combinations:
- 90 - 60 + 6 = 36 (This is not 100)
- 90 + 60 - 6 = 144 (This is not 100)
- 90 + 60 / 6 = 100 (This seems promising)
- 90 - 60 + 6 = 36 (This is not 100 again, just for clarity)
The combination 90 + 60 / 6 equals 100.
</think>
<answer> 90 + 60 / 6 </answer>

- Other combinations like (84 / 42) + 22, 84 + 42 - 22, etc., do not give 20.
Thus, the correct equation is 84 - 42 - 22 = 20.

This combination works as it uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 20.

<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 55, 79, and 40 that equals 64. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Starting with subtraction: 79 - 55 - 40 = -16 (doesn't work)
- Trying addition and subtraction: 79 + 55 - 40 = 94 (doesn't work)
- Using multiplication and addition: 55 * 40 / 79 doesn't result in 64
- Trying a combination with 40: 79 - (55 - 40) = 79 - 15 = 64 (this works)
So the equation that equals 64 is 79 - (55 - 40).

- Next, let's try subtraction: 71 - 44 + 56 = 83, which looks promising.
Therefore, the equation that equals 83 is 71 - 44 + 56.

- 91 - 8 - 6 - 25 = 52
- 91 - 8 - 25 - 6 = 52
- 91 - 8 + 25 - 6 = 92
- 91 - 25 - 6 - 8 = 52
- 91 - 25 + 6 - 8 = 64
This last combination (91 - 25 + 6 - 8) equals 64. So the equation is 91 - 25 + 6 - 8 = 64.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 25 + 6 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 91, 6, 8, and 25 that equals 64. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One possible combination could be: 91 - 8 - 6 - 25
Let's calculate: 
91 - 8 = 83
83 - 6 = 77
77 - 25 = 52
52 is not 64, so this combination doesn't work. Let's try another one.
Another possible combination could be: 91 - 8 + 6 - 25
Let's calculate:
91 - 8 = 83
83 + 6 = 89
89 - 25 = 64
64 is the target number, so this combination works.

<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 77, 64, and 55 that equals 68. Let's try combining the numbers in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
- Considering addition: 77 + 64 + 55 = 196 (This is too high)
- Considering subtraction: 77 - 64 + 55 = 68 (This could work)
- Considering multiplication and division doesn't seem to help in reaching 68 with these numbers

So, 77 - 64 + 55 = 68 is the correct equation.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 64 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 77, 64, and 55 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- First, let's consider the possibility of subtraction: 77 - 64 = 13, which is not 68.
- Next, try addition and subtraction: 77 + 64 - 55 = 135 - 55 = 80, which is close but too high.
- Now let's test another combination: 77 - 64 + 55 = 13 + 55 = 68.
This combination seems to work.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 64 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 77, 64, and 55 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 77 + 64 + 55 = 196 (This is too high)
- 77 + 64 - 55 = 86 (This is also too high)
- 77 + 64 / 55 = 80.09 (This is not an integer and doesn't equal 68)
- 77 - 64 + 55 = 68 (This equals 68)
- 77 / 55 + 64 = 17.27 (This is not an integer and doesn't equal 68)
- 64 - 55 + 77 = 86 (This is not 68)
The combination 77 - 64 + 55 does indeed give us 68. </think>
<answer> 77 - 64 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 26 using the numbers 1, 10, 15, and 32 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 32 - 15 - 10 = 7 (Doesn't work)
- 32 - 10 - 15 = 17 (Doesn't work)
- 32 - 15 + 10 = 27 (Doesn't work)
- 32 - 10 + 15 = 37 (Doesn't work)
- 32 + 15 - 10 = 37 (Doesn't work)
- 32 + 10 - 15 = 27 (Doesn't work)
- 15 + 10 + 32 = 57 (Doesn't work)
- 10 + 15 + 32 = 57 (Doesn't work)
- 10 + 15 - 32 = -7 (Doesn't work)
- 10 + 32 - 15 = 27 (Doesn't work)
- 10 + 15 + 32 = 57 (Doesn't work)
- 15 + 32 - 10 = 37 (Doesn't work)
I missed a few combinations. Let me try:
- 15 + 10 + 32 - 1 = 56 (Doesn't work)
- 15 + 32 + 10 - 1 = 56 (Doesn't work)
- 10 + 15 - 32 + 1 = -6 (Doesn't work)
- 10 + 32 + 15 - 1 = 56 (Doesn't work)
Finally, I realize a correct combination:
- 32 + 10 - 15 + 1 = 28 (This is close but not 26)
I realize an earlier combination was closer:
- 15 + 10 + 32 - 15 = 32 (This isn't it either)
I realize:
- A possible solution is 32 + 10 - 15 - 1
Lets verify again:
32 + 10 - 15 - 1 = 26
Hence, the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 10 - 15 - 1 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 78, 18, and 90 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- 78 + 18 + 90 = 186 (too high)
- 78 + 18 - 90 = 108 (too high)
- 78 + (18 - 90) = -94 (not valid as it uses 90 more than once)
- (78 - 18) + 90 = 210 (too high)
- 78 - (18 + 90) = -112 (not valid as it uses 18 more than once)
- (78 - 90) + 18 = 6 (too low)
- (90 - 78) + 18 = 18 (too low)
- 90 + (78 - 18) = 150 (too high)
- 90 + (78 + 18) = 186 (too high)
- 90 + (18 - 78) = -50 (not valid as it uses 78 more than once)
- 90 - (78 - 18) = 30 (this works)
So, the correct equation is 90 - (78 - 18) = 30.
</think>
<answer> 90 - (78 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 38, and 30 that equals 89. I should try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
Let's try: 38 + 30 - 21
38 + 30 = 68
68 - 21 = 47
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
Let's try: 38 + (30 - 21)
30 - 21 = 9
38 + 9 = 47
This still doesn't work. Let's try one more combination:
Let's try: 38 + (30 + 21)
30 + 21 = 51
38 + 51 = 89
This works! So the equation is 38 + (30 + 21) = 89.
</think>
<answer> 38 + (30 + 21) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 60 using the numbers 57, 37, 31, and 3 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
57 + 37 + 31 + 3 = 128 (This is too high)
57 + 37 + 31 - 3 = 116 (Still too high)
57 + 37 - 31 + 3 = 66 (Too high, but close)
57 + 37 - 31 - 3 = 50 (Not quite there)
Let's try a different permutation:
37 + 57 - 31 = 64 (Close, but still off)
37 + 57 - 31 + 3 = 68 (Close, but we need 60)
37 + 57 - 31 - 3 = 60 (This matches our target)
So, the equation is 37 + 57 - 31 - 3 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 37 + 57 - 31 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 13 using the numbers 24, 16, 19, and 2 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
(24 - 16) + 19 + 2 = 8 + 19 + 2 = 29 (not 13)
24 + (16 - 19) + 2 = 24 + (-3) + 2 = 23 (-3 is negative, let's try multiplication and division)
(24 / 16) * 19 + 2 = 1.5 * 19 + 2 = 28.5 (not an integer, so not correct)
(24 - 16) + (19 * 2) = 8 + 38 = 46 (too high)
Now let's try another approach using division and addition:
24 + 16 / 2 - 19 = 24 + 8 - 19 = 13
This works because 16 divided by 2 is 8, and adding 24 and 8 gives 32, then subtracting 19 results in 13.
</think>
<answer> 24 + 16 / 2 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 63 using the numbers 70, 55, 98, and 20 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
70 - 55 = 15
15 + 20 = 35
35 + 98 = 133 (this is too large)
Let's try another combination:
98 - 70 = 28
28 + 55 = 83 (this is also too large)
Now let's try:
98 - 70 = 28
20 + 55 = 75
28 + 20 + 55 = 103 (still too large)
Trying a different order:
70 + 55 = 125
125 - 98 = 27
27 + 20 = 47 (this is too small)
Next, trying:
98 + 55 = 153
153 - 70 = 83 (this is too large)
I should try:
98 - 55 = 43
43 + 70 = 113 (too large)
Finally, another combination:
70 + 20 = 90
90 - 55 = 35
35 + 98 = 133 (too large)
Eventually, I found a correct combination:
98 - 70 + 55 - 20
98 - 70 = 28
28 + 55 = 83
83 - 20 = 63
</think>
<answer> 98 - 70 + 55 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 99 using the numbers 2, 32, and 69 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination could be: 69 + 32 - 2
69 + 32 = 101
101 - 2 = 99
This gives us the desired result of 99. So the equation is 69 + 32 - 2.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 32 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 43, 2, and 8 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 43 + 2 + 8 = 53
This combination uses all the numbers and equals 53.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 2 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 43, 2, and 8 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 43 + 2 + 8 = 53 (This works, but we should check if there's another possibility)
- 8 + 2 + 43 = 53 (This also works)
By checking, we see that 43 + 2 + 8 = 53 is a valid equation.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 2 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 91 using the numbers 59, 72, and 78 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- First, let's see if multiplication or division can help: (59 * 72) / 78 = 46.28 or (78 * 59) / 72 = 60.83, neither equals 91.
- Let's try addition and subtraction: 72 + 78 - 59 = 91, this equals 91.
So, the equation 72 + 78 - 59 equals 91.
</think>
<answer> 72 + 78 - 59 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 8, 61, 43, and 64 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
8 + 61 + 43 + 64 = 176 (This is too large)
64 + 43 + 61 - 8 = 159 (This is also too large)
64 + 43 - 61 - 8 = 38 (This seems to be the right combination)
So the correct equation is 64 + 43 - 61 - 8 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 64 + 43 - 61 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 43 using the numbers 73, 77, and 39 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 73 - 77 + 39 = 39 - 77 + 73 is not 43
- 73 + 77 - 39 = 147 - 39 = 108 is not 43
- 77 + 39 - 73 = 116 - 73 = 43 This seems to be the correct equation.
After testing these combinations, I've found that 77 + 39 - 73 equals 43.
</think>
<answer> 77 + 39 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 8, 3, and 66 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- One approach could be to check if adding or subtracting can get close to 90:
  - 66 + 8 + 3 = 77 (not equal to 90)
  - 66 + 8 - 3 = 71 (not equal to 90)
  - 66 - 8 + 3 = 61 (not equal to 90)
- Another approach could be to try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
  - 66 * (8 - 3) = 66 * 5 = 330 (too large)
  - (66 * 8) - 3 = 528 - 3 = 525 (too large)
  - (8 * 3) + 66 = 24 + 66 = 90
Thus, the equation that equals 90 is (8 * 3) + 66.
</think>
<answer>(8 * 3) + 66</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 8, 3, and 66 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination is: 66 + 3 + 8
66 + 3 equals 69, and then adding 8 gives us 77, which is not 90.
Let's try another combination: 66 + (8 - 3)
66 + (8 - 3) equals 66 + 5, which is 71, still not 90.
Let's try: 66 + 8 - 3
66 + 8 equals 74, and then subtracting 3 gives us 71, still not 90.
Let's try: (66 - 8) + 3
(66 - 8) equals 58, and then adding 3 gives us 61, still not 90.
Let's try: (66 + 8) - 3
(66 + 8) equals 74, and then subtracting 3 gives us 71, still not 90.
Now let's try a different approach: (66 - 3) + 8
(66 - 3) equals 63, and then adding 8 gives us 71, still not 90.
Let's try one last combination: (66 + 8) + 3
(66 + 8) equals 74, and then adding 3 gives us 77, still not 90.
There seems to be no combination of these operations that gives us 90. Let me re-evaluate the equation again:
(66 * 3) + 8
66 * 3 equals 198, and then adding 8 gives us 206, which is too high.
None of the possible combinations seem to fit with these digits and operations. I might've overlooked simpler operations. Let me re-check again in other manner:
66 + 8 * 3
66 + 8 * 3 equals 66 + 24, which is 90.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 8 * 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need an equation that uses the numbers 85, 92, 34, and 12 that equals 39. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
One possible combination is: 92 - 85 - 34 + 12
92 - 85 = 7
7 - 34 = -27
-27 + 12 = -15
This does not work. Let's try another one:
92 - 85 + 34 - 12
92 - 85 = 7
7 + 34 = 41
41 - 12 = 29
This does not work either. Let's try one more:
85 - 92 + 34 - 12
85 - 92 = -7
-7 + 34 = 27
27 - 12 = 15
None of these work. Let's try:
34 + 12 - 92 + 85
34 + 12 = 46
46 - 92 = -46
-46 + 85 = 39
This works as it equals 39. </think>
<answer> 34 + 12 - 92 + 85 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 14, 1, and 45 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the arithmetic operations:
- First, consider if multiplication or division could bring us closer to 58. Multiplying 14 by 45 gives 630, which is too high. Dividing 45 by 14 gives approximately 3.21, also not useful.
- Now, let's try adding and subtracting the numbers:
  - 45 + 14 - 1 = 58, which is exactly what we need.
This combination works because 45 + 14 equals 59, and subtracting 1 from 59 yields 58.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 14 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 14, 1, and 45 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
14 + 1 + 45 = 59 (not 58)
14 + 45 - 1 = 58 (this could be the right combination)
So, the equation that equals 58 is 14 + 45 - 1.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 14, 43, 54, and 11 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
(54 - 43) + 14 + 11 = 11 + 14 + 11 = 36
This combination works because 54 - 43 = 11, then adding 14 and 11 gives us 36.
</think>
<answer> (54 - 43) + 14 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 42, 53, and 51 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
42 + 53 + 51 = 146 (This is too high)
53 + 51 - 42 = 62 (This is close, but not 84)
42 + 51 + 53 = 146 (This is the same as the first combination, just in a different order)
53 - 51 + 42 = 44 (This is too low)
42 * (53 - 51) = 84 (This gives us 84, which is our target)
So the correct equation is 42 * (53 - 51) = 84.
</think>
<answer> 42 * (53 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 39, 1, 27, and 25 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 39 + 1 + 27 + 25 = 92 (too high)
- 25 + 27 + 1 + 39 = 92 (too high)
- 39 + 27 + 1 + 25 = 92 (too high)
- 25 + 39 + 27 + 1 = 92 (too high)
- 39 + 25 - 27 + 1 = 38 (too low)
- 27 + 1 + 39 + 25 = 92 (too high)
- 25 + 1 + 27 + 39 = 92 (too high)
- 1 + 27 + 39 + 25 = 92 (too high)
It seems like direct addition/subtraction of these numbers won't work. Let me try different sequences:
- (39 - 27) + (25 - 1) = 12 + 24 = 36 (not 40)
- (39 + 25) - (27 + 1) = 64 - 28 = 36 (not 40)
- (39 + 25) - (27 - 1) = 64 - 26 = 38 (not 40)
- (39 + 27) - (25 + 1) = 66 - 26 = 40
This combination works! </think>
<answer> (39 + 27) - (25 + 1) </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 87 using the numbers 24, 94, and 31 exactly once. Let's try combining these numbers using different operations.
One possible way is to consider if there's a combination of operations that might work. Let's try:
94 - 31 = 63
Then we need 24 more to get to 87:
63 + 24 = 87
So the equation could be 94 - 31 + 24 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 31 + 24 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 87 using the numbers 24, 94, and 31 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
24 + 94 + 31 = 149 (This is too high)
94 + 31 - 24 = 101 (This is also too high)
24 + 94 - 31 = 87 (This looks promising)
So the equation that works is 24 + 94 - 31 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 24 + 94 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 87 using the numbers 24, 94, and 31 exactly once. Let's try combining them in different ways:
- Adding the numbers: 24 + 94 + 31 = 149 (not 87)
- Subtracting: There doesn't seem to be a combination that works with subtraction either.
- Multiplying: 24 * 94 = 2256 (not 87), and other combinations like 24 * 31 or 94 * 31 also don't work.
- Dividing or combination with division: 94 / 31 = 3 (not 87), 24 / 31 = 0.77 (not 87), swapping doesn't help either.
It seems I missed a simple combination:
24 + 94 - 31 = 87
This meets the requirement of using each number exactly once.

<answer> 24 + 94 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 91 using the numbers 80, 23, and 34 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- If I add 80 and 23, I get 103, which is close but too high.
- If I subtract 34 from 80, I get 46, which when added to 23 gives 69, still too low.
- If I subtract 23 from 80, I get 57, and then adding 34 gives 91, which is what we want.
So the equation is 80 - 23 + 34 = 91.

Let's try:
(83 - 19) + 49 = 65 (which is still too high)
Now let's try a different order:
(83 + 19) - 49 = 53
This gives us the correct result of 53.

- 83 + 19 = 102 (not 53)
- 49 - 19 = 30 (not 53)
- 49 + 19 = 68 (not 53)
- 83 + 49 - 19 = 113 - 19 = 94 (not 53)
- 83 - 49 + 19 = 34 + 19 = 53 (this works)
So the equation that equals 53 is 83 - 49 + 19.

90 + 51 + 72 + 91 = 294 (too high)
91 + 72 + 51 - 90 = 124 (too high)
91 + 72 - 51 - 90 = -57 (too low)
91 - 72 + 51 + 90 = 160 (too high)
91 + 72 - 90 - 51 = 22 (too low)
91 - 72 - 51 + 90 = 58 (this works)
So the correct equation is 91 - 72 - 51 + 90 = 58 </think>
<answer> 91 - 72 - 51 + 90 </answer>

55 - 79 + 66 - 15 does not work as it equals -3
Let's try another combination:
55 + 79 - 66 - 15 = 53

So the equation that works is 96 + 16 - 34 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 96 + 16 - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 16, 96, and 34 exactly once, with the available arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 16 - 34 = 46 (not 78)
- 96 - 16 + 34 = 114 (not 78)
- 96 + 16 - 34 = 78 (this looks promising)

<answer> 80 - 28 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 97, 19, 30, and 18 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
18 + 30 = 48
97 - 19 = 78
48 + 78 = 126 (This is too high)
Let's try another combination:
97 + 19 = 116
116 - 30 = 86
86 - 18 = 68 (This is too low)
Let's try another approach:
97 + 30 = 127
127 - 19 = 108
108 - 18 = 90
This gives us the correct result of 90.
</think>
<answer> 97 + 30 - 19 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 77, 42, 43, and 66 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
77 + 42 - 43 - 66 = 77 + 42 - (43 + 66) = 119 - 109 = 10
77 + 42 - 43 + 66 = 77 + 42 + 66 - 43 = 121 + 23 = 144 (too high)
77 + 42 + 43 - 66 = 119 + 43 - 66 = 162 - 66 = 96 (too high)
77 + 42 + 66 - 43 = 119 + 66 - 43 = 185 - 43 = 142 (too high)
77 + (42 + 43 - 66) = 77 + (85 - 66) = 77 + 19 = 96 (too high)
77 + (42 - 43 + 66) = 77 + (43 + 66) - 43 = 77 + 66 = 143 (too high)
77 + 42 + 43 + 66 - 100 = (77 + 42 + 43 + 66) - 100 = 228 - 100 = 128 (too high)
77 - 42 + 43 + 66 = 35 + 43 + 66 = 144 (too high)
(77 + 42 + 43) - 66 = 162 - 66 = 96 (too high)
(77 + 66 + 42) - 43 = 183 - 43 = 140 (too high)
Only one combination is correct:
66 + 42 + 43 - 77 = 105 - 77 = 28
None of these correctly results in 58, so I need to try different operations.
(77 - 42) + 43 + 66 = 35 + 43 + 66 = 144 (too high)
(77 + 42 + 43) - 66 = 162 - 66 = 96 (too high)
(77 + 42 + 66) - 43 = 183 - 43 = 140 (too high)
Finally, I see that the correct combination is not getting the right result. I try another step
(77 + 42) - (43 + 66) = 119 - 109 = 10 (Hence none of the above steps in critical for final solution)
Lastly check: (77 + 66) - 42 - 43 = 143 - 43 - 42 = 100 - 42 = 58
Thus: 143 - 43 - 42 = 58

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 12 using the numbers 36, 4, and 1 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- \(36 - 4 - 1 = 31\) (not 12)
- \(36 - 4 + 1 = 33\) (not 12)
- \(36 + 4 - 1 = 39\) (not 12)
- \(36 + 4 + 1 = 41\) (not 12)
- \(36 / 4 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) (not 12)
- \(36 / (4 - 1) = 36 / 3 = 12\) (this works)
So the correct equation is \(36 / (4 - 1) = 12\).

- 52 + 15 + 32 = 99 (This is too high)
- 52 - 15 + 32 = 69 (This looks promising)
So the equation 52 - 15 + 32 equals 69.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 15 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 69 using the numbers 32, 15, and 52 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
One combination that might work is: (52 - 32) + 15
Calculating this:
52 - 32 = 20
20 + 15 = 35
This doesn't give us 69. Let's try another combination: 52 + (32 - 15)
Calculating this:
32 - 15 = 17
52 + 17 = 69
This gives us the right result of 69.
</think>
<answer> 52 + (32 - 15) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 56 using the numbers 22, 16, and 50 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One combination could be using addition and subtraction:
50 + 16 - 22 = 86 - 22 = 64, which is not 56.
Let's try another combination:
22 + 50 - 16 = 72 - 16 = 56
This gives us the correct result of 56. So the equation is 22 + 50 - 16.
</think>
<answer> 22 + 50 - 16 </answer>

- 82 + 62 - 71 = 73 (this looks promising)
- 82 - 62 + 71 = 91 (already calculated, not 73)
- 82 * 62 / 71 = 78. 4014 (not 73)
The combination 82 + 62 - 71 equals 73.
</think>
<answer> 82 + 62 - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 51 using the numbers 94, 56, 63, and 50 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
94 - 56 - 63 is -27
94 - 56 + 63 is 101
94 + 56 - 63 is 87
94 + 56 + 63 is 213
94 + 56 - 50 is 90
50 + 63 - 56 is 57
50 + 56 + 63 is 169
None of these combinations work. Let's try rearranging:
50 + 63 - 56 + 94 = 169
None of these work either. Let's try this:
50 + 63 + 56 - 94 = 75
50 + 94 + 63 - 56 = 191
50 + 94 + 63 - 56 = 191
Finally, we get:
50 + 56 + 63 - 94 = 75
This isn't 51. Another rearrangement:
94 - 63 - 56 + 50 = 27
94 - 63 + 56 - 50 = 37
94 - 56 + 63 - 50 = 51
This works, so the equation is 94 - 56 + 63 - 50 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 56 + 63 - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 79 using the numbers 30, 94, and 45 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination could be: 94 - 30 - 45
94 - 30 equals 64
64 - 45 equals 19
But we need 79, so this doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
94 - 45 - 30
94 - 45 equals 49
49 - 30 equals 19
This also doesn't give us 79. Let's try:
30 + 94 - 45
30 + 94 equals 124
124 - 45 equals 79
This works! So the equation is 30 + 94 - 45 = 79.

This combination works because:
43 + 44 = 87
87 - 24 = 63
63 - 41 = 22
So the equation is 43 + 44 - 24 - 41 = 22.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 100 using the numbers 99, 72, and 71 exactly once. One approach is to consider the possibility of combining numbers through arithmetic operations.
Let's try: 99 + 72 - 71
99 + 72 = 171
171 - 71 = 100
So the equation is 99 + 72 - 71 = 100. </think>
<answer> 99 + 72 - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 100 using the numbers 99, 72, and 71 once each. 
Let's try different combinations:
99 - 72 + 71 = 99 - 72 + 71 = 71 + 27 = 99
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
71 - 72 + 99 = 71 - 72 + 99 = -1 + 99 = 98
This is close but not quite 100. Let's try:
99 + 72 - 71 = 99 + 72 - 71 = 171 - 71 = 100
This combination works as it gives us the result 100. </think>
<answer> 99 + 72 - 71 </answer>

- 81 + 65 + 81 = 227 (This is too large)
- 81 + 81 - 65 = 97 (This seems to be the right combination)
So the equation is 81 + 81 - 65 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 81 + 81 - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 90, 15, 1, and 94 that equals 12. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination is: 94 - 90 + 1 - 15
Calculating it: 
94 - 90 = 4
4 + 1 = 5
5 - 15 = -10
This doesn't give us 12. Let's try another combination: 
90 - 94 + 15 + 1
Calculating it:
90 - 94 = -4
-4 + 15 = 11
11 + 1 = 12
So, the equation 90 - 94 + 15 + 1 equals 12.

89 - 66 = 23
We have a 23 already, so we can use it:
So the equation is:
(86 - 71) + 51 + 23 = 89
</think>
<answer>(86 - 71) + 51 + 23</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 89 using the numbers 71, 86, 23, and 51 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
71 + 86 = 157 (not what we want)
86 + 23 = 109 (not what we want)
86 + 51 = 137 (not what we want)
71 + 23 = 94 (not what we want)
71 + 51 = 122 (not what we want)
86 - 71 = 15 (not what we want)
86 - 23 = 63 (not what we want)
86 - 51 = 35 (not what we want)
71 - 51 = 20 (not what we want)
Notice, we missed a simple combination. Let's try:
86 - 51 + 71 = 86 - 51 + 71 = 35 + 71 = 106 (not what we want yet)
Keep trying:
86 - 71 + 51 = 86 - 71 + 51 = 15 + 51 = 66 (still not 89)
Checking next:
86 - (71 - 51) = 86 - 23 = 63 (still not 89)
Finally try another mixed combination:
86 + (71 - 23) = 86 + 48 = 134 (no, not 89)
Trying one step further:
(86 + 71) - 51 = 157 - 51 = 106 (no, not 89)
Checking wisely another work:
(86 - 23) + (71 - 51) = 63 + 20 = 83 (no, not 89)
Finally after these calculate approaches we get a final combined equation:
Let us try:
86 - (86 - 71) - 23 = 86 - (15) - 23 = 86 - 15 - 23 = 86 - 38 = 48
Detailed calculation check:
86 - 71 + 23 = 15 + 23 = 38 (misplaced)
Final possible right fair operation:
(86 - 71) + (51 + 23) = 15 + 74 = 89
</think>

33 + 56 - 96 = 23 (not 73)
33 + 96 - 56 = 73 (this looks promising)
56 + 96 - 33 = 119 (not 73)
So, the correct combination is 33 + 96 - 56 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 33 + 96 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 33, 56, and 96 exactly once. Let's try combining them with basic operations.
One possible combination could be: 96 - 33 + 56
96 - 33 = 63
63 + 56 = 119
This is too high. Let's try another one: 96 - (33 + 56)
First, calculate the sum inside the parenthesis: 33 + 56 = 89
Then subtract this from 96: 96 - 89 = 7
This is close but not quite 73. Let's try a different approach: 96 + 33 - 56
96 + 33 = 129
129 - 56 = 73
This gives us the correct result of 73.
</think>
<answer> 96 + 33 - 56 </answer>

- 57 - 29 - 47 = -17
- 57 - 29 + 47 = 75
- 57 + 29 - 47 = 39 - This looks promising.
- 57 + 29 + 47 = 133
- 57 * 29 / 47 is not a whole number and doesn't simplify to 39
Thus, the equation that works is 57 + 29 - 47 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 29 - 47 </answer>

32 - 70 = -38 (this doesn't help)
34 - 37 = -3
Let's try:
70 - 34 - 37 + 32 = 31
This works because:
70 - 34 = 36
36 - 37 = -1
-1 + 32 = 31
So the equation is 70 - 34 - 37 + 32 = 31.

73 + 16 - 69 = 10 (not equal to 20)
69 + 16 - 73 = 4 (not equal to 20)
69 - 73 + 16 = 12 (not equal to 20)
16 + 69 - 73 = 2 (not equal to 20)
16 + 73 - 69 = 20 (this works)
So the correct equation is 16 + 73 - 69 = 20. </think>
<answer> 16 + 73 - 69 </answer>

86 + 2 - 55 = 33 (not 29)
55 + 2 - 86 = -31 (not 29)
86 - 55 + 2 = 33 (not 29)
86 - 55 - 2 = 29 (this could be the solution)
So, the equation that equals 29 is 86 - 55 - 2.

77 + 94 + 70 - 63 = 188 (Too high)
77 + 94 - 63 - 70 = 48 (Too high)
94 + 70 - 77 - 63 = 24 (Too low)
77 + 70 - 94 - 63 = -20 (Too low)
70 + 94 - 77 - 63 = 24 (Too low)
70 + 63 - 94 - 77 = -74 (Too low)
63 + 94 - 77 - 70 = 20 (Too low)
63 + 70 + 77 - 94 = 116 (Too high)
63 + 70 - 94 - 77 = -84 (Too low)
63 + 70 + 77 - 94 = 156 (Too high)
77 - 63 + 94 - 70 = 48 (Too high)
77 - 63 + 94 - 70 = 48 (Too high)
We missed something simple. Let's try another approach:
63 + 70 - 94 - 77 = -84 (Too low)
94 - 77 - 70 + 63 = 40 (Too high)
77 - 94 + 63 - 70 = 0 (Too low)
63 + 77 - 94 + 70 = 164 (Too high)
Running out of options, we finally realized:
77 + 63 - 94 - 70 = -24 (Too low)
Using these steps, we determined:

66 + 64 - 16 - 32 = 82 (This is also too large)
(66 - 64) * 16 + 32 = 2 * 16 + 32 = 32 + 32 = 64 (This is too large)
16 + 66 + 32 - 64 = 46 (This is close but not 50)
I notice if I rearrange:
66 - (64 - 16) - 32 = 66 - 48 - 32 = 18 - 32 = -14 (This is not 50)
But if I look closely:
(66 - 64) + 32 + 16 = 2 + 32 + 16 = 50 (This fits exactly)

This is close, but not 52. Let's try one more combination:
80 - 74 = 6
6 + 13 = 19
59 - 19 = 40
This isn't 52 either. It seems I need to re-evaluate. Let's consider this:
74 + 13 = 87
87 - 80 = 7
52 - 7 = 45 (not 52)
Different possibilities repeat. I need an exact value searched and found:

81 + 21 + 43 + 11 = 156 (this is also too high)
81 + 43 + 21 + 11 = 156 (this is too high as well)
81 + 11 + 21 + 43 = 156 (still too high)
Let's try rearranging:

81 + 11 - 43 + 21 = 50 (too low)
Finally, let's try:
81 + 21 + 43 - 11 = 134 (too high)
Let me try a permutation I missed:

<think> We need an equation that equals 41 using the numbers 76, 87, and 30 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 87 - 76 = 11
- 87 - 30 = 57
- 76 - 30 = 46
None of these work alone. Let's try adding some:
- 87 - 30 + 76 = 133 (too high)
- 87 + 30 - 76 = 41 (this works)
So the equation is 87 + 30 - 76 = 41. </think>
<answer> 87 + 30 - 76 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 41 using the numbers 76, 87, and 30 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
76 + 87 + 30 = 193 (This is too high)
76 + 87 - 30 = 133 (This is also too high)
76 - 87 + 30 = 23 (This is too low)
87 - 76 + 30 = 41 (This could be the correct equation)
So the correct equation is 87 - 76 + 30 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 76 + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 30, 45, and 38 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
38 + 45 = 83 (which is not 53)
45 + 30 = 75 (which is not 53)
38 + 30 = 68 (which is not 53)
Now, let's try the permutations with subtraction:
45 - 38 + 30 = 7 + 30 = 37 (which is not 53)
Let's try another permutation:
38 + 45 - 30 = 83 - 30 = 53 (this is the correct combination)
</think>
<answer> 38 + 45 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 96 using the numbers 35, 91, and 30 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 91 - 35 - 30 = 26 (Not 96)
- 91 - 35 + 30 = 86 (Not 96)
- 91 + 35 - 30 = 96 (This could be the answer)
So, the equation that equals 96 is 91 + 35 - 30.
</think>
<answer> 91 + 35 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 26 using the numbers 78, 2, 47, and 3 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
78 - 47 = 31 (not 26)
31 + 2 = 33 (not 26)
This seems incorrect. Let me try another approach:
78 - 47 = 31
31 - 2 = 29 (not 26)
Another approach:
31 + 3 = 34 (not 26)
What if I rearrange:
2 + 3 = 5
78 - 47 = 31
31 - 5 = 26 (this works!)
So the equation is 78 - 47 - (2 + 3) = 26 </think>
<answer> 78 - 47 - (2 + 3) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 56 using the numbers 1, 21, and 36 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
1 + 21 + 36 = 68 (This is too high)
36 + 21 - 1 = 56 (This seems to be the right combination)
So the equation is 36 + 21 - 1 = 56.
</think>
<answer> 36 + 21 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 56 using the numbers 1, 21, and 36 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 21 + 36 + 1 = 58 (too high)
- 36 + 21 + 1 = 58 (too high)
- 36 + (21 - 1) = 56 (this could work)
So the equation that works is 36 + (21 - 1) = 56.
</think>
<answer> 36 + (21 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> We need an equation that equals 20 using the numbers 85, 74, and 31 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
85 - 74 = 11
11 + 31 = 42 (too high)
85 + 74 = 159 (too high)
85 + (74 - 31) = 85 + 43 = 128 (too high)
85 - (74 - 31) = 85 - 43 = 42 (too high)
Trying another combination:
74 - (85 - 31) = 74 - 54 = 20
This works because:
74 - (85 - 31) = 74 - 54 = 20
</think>
<answer> 74 - (85 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 87 using the numbers 77, 73, and 91 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
77 + 73 + 91 = 241 (This is too high)
91 + 77 - 73 = 95 (This is close but not 87)
77 + 91 - 73 = 95 (This is not 87 either)
73 + 91 - 77 = 87 (This works, as it equals 87)
So, the correct equation is 73 + 91 - 77.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 91 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 45 using the numbers 49, 98, 83, and 19 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
49 + 98 + 83 + 19 = 249 (too large)
98 + 83 + 19 - 49 = 141 (too large)
49 + 98 + 19 - 83 = 85 (too large)
98 + 83 - 49 - 19 = 113 (too large)
98 + 49 - 83 - 19 = 45 (this works)
So the equation is 98 + 49 - 83 - 19 = 45.
</think>
<answer> 98 + 49 - 83 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 24 using the numbers 78, 5, and 97 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
78 - 97 + 5 = -4 (not 24)
97 - 78 + 5 = 20 (not 24)
78 + 97 - 5 = 170 (not 24)
5 * 97 - 78 = 415 - 78 = 337 (not 24)
Trying another combination:
5 * (97 - 78) = 5 * 19 = 95 (not 24)
5 * (78 - 97) = 5 * (-19) = -95 (not 24)
None of the above combinations work. Let me try:
(97 - 78) * 5 = 19 * 5 = 95 (not 24)
97 + 78 - 5 = 170 - 5 = 165 (not 24)
Finally, the right combination:
78 + (97 - 5) = 78 + 92 = 170 (not 24)
Still not 24. Let me try:
5 * (97 - 78) = -95 (not 24)
No combination works yet. Rechecking everything:
78 + 5 * (97 - 78) = 78 + 5 * 19 = 78 + 95 = 173 (not 24)
After verification, the formation seems incorrect in all above:

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 64 using the numbers 28, 73, 30, and 79 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
28 + 73 + 30 + 79 = 200 (not 64)
79 + 30 + 73 - 28 = 154 (not 64)
79 + 30 - 73 + 28 = 64 (this works!)
So the correct equation is 79 + 30 - 73 + 28 = 64. </think>
<answer> 79 + 30 - 73 + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 64 using the numbers 28, 73, 30, and 79 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
28 + 73 + 30 + 79 = 200 (This is too high)
79 + 30 + 28 - 73 = 64 (This seems to be correct)
So the equation is 79 + 30 + 28 - 73 = 64.
</think>
<answer> 79 + 30 + 28 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 24 using the numbers 73, 34, and 63 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
73 - 34 - 63 = -54
63 - 34 - 73 = -64
73 - 63 - 34 = -24
34 - 63 - 73 = -102
None of the above combinations work. Let me try another approach:
73 + 34 - 63 = 44
This is close but not 24. Let me check the order again:
63 - 73 + 34 = 24
This combination works as 63 - 73 = -10 and then -10 + 34 = 24.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 73 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 77 using the numbers 93, 16, and 32 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
93 - 16 - 32 = 45

93 + 16 - 32 = 77
This shows that 93 + 16 - 32 = 77 is the correct equation.
</think>
<answer> 93 + 16 - 32 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 25 using the numbers 10, 1, and 36 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
10 + 1 + 36 = 47 (not 25)
10 + 36 - 1 = 45 (not 25)
36 + 10 - 1 = 45 (not 25)
10 + 36 / 1 = 46 (not 25)
36 - 10 - 1 = 25 (this works)
So the correct equation is 36 - 10 - 1 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 36 - 10 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 29 using the numbers 49, 7, and 13 exactly once. One way to approach this is to consider if any of the numbers can be combined to form a part of the solution. If we subtract 13 from 49, we get 36. Then if we subtract 7 from 36, we get 29. So the equation is 49 - 13 - 7 = 29. </think>
<answer> 49 - 13 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 61, 69, and 89 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
61 + 69 + 89 = 219 (not 81)
61 + 89 - 69 = 81 (this could be the equation we are looking for)
So the equation 61 + 89 - 69 equals 81.
</think>
<answer> 61 + 89 - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> We need an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 61, 69, and 89 only once. Let's try different combinations:
61 + 69 + 89 = 219 (not 81)
89 + 69 - 61 = 97 (not 81)
89 - 69 + 61 = 81 (this could be the right combination)
So the equation is 89 - 69 + 61 = 81.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 69 + 61 </answer>

<think> We need to create an equation that equals 39 using the numbers 12, 56, and 83 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
12 + 56 + 83 = 151 (This is too high)
56 + 83 - 12 = 127 (This is also too high)
12 * 56 / 83 = 7. 83 (This is not an integer and doesn't work)
Trying another combination:
56 + 83 - 12 = 127 (This is too high again)
Let's try different operations and number arrangements:
(83 - 56) + 12 = 39, which works.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 56) + 12 </answer>

54 + 65 - 53 = 66 (not 64)
65 + 54 - 53 = 66 (not 64)
54 + 65 - 53 = 66 (repeated calculation)
53 + 65 - 54 = 64 (this equals 64)
So the correct equation is 53 + 65 - 54 = 64. </think>
<answer> 53 + 65 - 54 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 77, 25, and 6 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
77 - 25 = 52
52 - 6 = 46
We need to reach 58, so this combination isn't correct. Let's try another:
77 + 25 = 102
102 - 6 = 96
This is close but still not 58. Let me try:
6 + 25 = 31
77 + 31 = 108
That's too high. Let's do this another way:
77 - 6 = 71
71 - 25 = 46
This is still not 58. Let's try:
25 + 6 = 31
77 - 31 = 46
This is still not 58. Let me re-evaluate different orders:
77 - 25 = 52
6 + 52 = 58
This could work. So the equation would be:
77 - 25 + 6 = 58
</think>
<answer> 77 - 25 + 6 </answer>

<think> We need to create an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 68, 53, and 91 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
68 + 53 + 91 = 212 (This is too high)
68 + 91 - 53 = 106 (This is also too high)
91 + 53 - 68 = 76 (This looks like a potential solution)
So the equation that equals 76 is 91 + 53 - 68.

<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 7, and 5 that equals 50. Let's try different combinations:
15 + 7 + 5 = 27 (This is too low)
15 + 7 - 5 = 17 (This is still too low)
15 - 7 + 5 = 13 (This is also too low)
Now let's try:
15 - (7 - 5) = 15 - 2 = 13 (This is still too low)
Let's try another combination:
15 + (7 * 5) = 15 + 35 = 50
This combination gives us the correct result of 50.</think>
<answer> 15 + (7 * 5) </answer>

14 + 5 * 10 = 64 (This looks promising, let's check: 14 + 50 = 64)
So, the equation that equals 64 is 14 + 5 * 10. </think>
<answer> 14 + 5 * 10 </answer>

- 88 + 14 + 8 = 110 (too high)
- 88 + 8 - 14 = 72 (too low)
- 88 - 14 + 8 = 74 (too low)
- 88 + (8 - 14) = 82 (this works)
So the equation is 88 + (8 - 14) = 82.

72 + 91 - 83 = 80 (not 64)
91 - 83 + 72 = 80 (not 64)
83 - 72 + 91 = 102 (not 64)
83 + 91 - 72 = 102 (not 64)
72 + 91 + 83 = 246 (more than 64)
None of these combinations work. Let me try another approach:
Given the numbers, we can consider using subtraction and addition:
91 - 72 + 83 = 18 + 83 = 101 (not 64)
I missed a simpler combination:
72 + (91 - 83) = 72 + 8 = 80 (not 64)
This is still not correct. I misinterpreted. I realize simpler calculation:
72 + (91/83) not practical but basic combination works:
91+72-83 = 163-83 = 80
So previous closer no. Gives:
Only simpler right double check:
83 + 91 - 72 = 114 - 72 = 42 not 64
go back main check:
91-83+72 gives closer but not 
91-83+72 = 18+72=90 
Doing actual simple is closer:
trail back 72+83-91 = 155-91  = 64 works correct need to show ///

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 31 using the numbers 26, 6, and 51 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
26 + 6 + 51 = 83 (This is too high)
26 + 51 - 6 = 71 (This is also too high)
26 - 51 + 6 = -19 (This is too low)
6 + 26 - 51 = -15 (This is too low)
Now let's try another combination:
51 - 26 + 6 = 26 (This is not 31)
51 - 6 + 26 = 71 (This is too high again)
We missed a combination:
26 + 51 - 6 = 71 (This is too high)
51 + 6 - 26 = 31 (This gives us our required result of 31)
So the correct equation is 51 + 6 - 26 = 31.

80 + 28 - 15 = 93 (not 37)
80 + 28 + 15 = 123 (not 37)
We missed something simple. Let's recheck:
80 - (28 + 15) = 80 - 43 = 37
This gives us the correct result of 37.

- 9 * 6 = 54 (close, but not 63)
- 9 * 1 + 6 = 15 (too low)
- 6 * 9 + 1 = 55 (too high)
- 9 + 6 * 1 = 15 (too low)
- 6 + 9 * 1 = 15 (too low)
- 6 * 9 + 1 = 55 (too high)
- 6 * (9 + 1) = 60 (too high)
After trying multiple combinations, I realize there might be a misinterpretation of rules or the need for parentheses:
- 9 + 6 * 1 = 15 (too low)
- 6 * (9 + 1) = 60 (too high)
It seems I need to use parentheses to change the order of operations.
Rechecking:
- (9 * 6) + 1 = 54 + 1 = 55
- 9 * (6 + 1) = 9 * 7 = 63 (perfect)
Here, correctly placing parentheses gives: 9 * (6 + 1) = 63.

47 + 68 - 10 = 105 (not 11)
68 + 47 - 10 = 105 (not 11)
Now let's try:
68 - 47 - 10 = -19 (not 11)
10 + 68 - 47 = 28 - 47 = -19 (not 11)
Trying another way:
68 + 47 / 10 = 68 + 4. 7 = 72. 7 (not 11)
68 - 47 * 10 / 10 = 68 - 47 = 21 (not 11)
Finally:
47 * 10 / 68 = 470 / 68 = 7. 04 (not 11)
Then another possibility:
10 + 47 - 68 = -11 (not positive 11)
But let's try:
68 - 10 - 47 = 68 - 57 = 11

64 + 81 - 23 = 122 (not 40)
64 - 81 + 23 = 8 (not 40)
81 - 64 + 23 = 39 (not 40)
81 + 64 - 23 = 122 (not 40)
81 - (64 - 23) = 40 (this equals 40)
So the equation that works is 81 - (64 - 23) = 40.
</think>
<answer> 81 - (64 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 64, 81, and 23 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
64 + 81 + 23 = 168 (too large)
64 + 81 - 23 = 122 (too large)
64 + 81 / 23 = 83.91 (not an integer)

81 - 64 + 23 = 39 (close but not 40)
64 - 81 + 23 = 8 (not 40)
64 / 81 + 23 = 23.82 (not an integer)
81 - 64 - 23 = -8 (too small)
Trying rearranged operations or different pairs isn't leading to the target number, the first comb won't work if we need integers, except trivial arithmetic's fit into whole integrals yet. Should retain initial order, 81 - 64 + 23 did not fit implying on other potentials or operations detailing above non found as much needed exact.

67 + 18 - 46 - 1 = 40 (too low)
67 - 18 - 46 + 1 = -16 (too low)
Then I see:
67 + 18 + 1 - 46 = 40 (too low)
67 + 18 + 46 - 1 = 120 (too high)
67 + 18 - 46 + 1 = 40 (too low)
67 + 18 - 1 + 46 = 120 (too high)
Then I see:

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 31, 73, 65, and 26 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
31 + 73 + 65 - 26 = 143 - 26 = 117 (not 65)
31 + 73 + 26 + 65 = 191 (too high)
73 + 65 + 26 - 31 = 164 - 31 = 133 (too high)
None of the above combinations work. Now let's try:
31 + 73 + 65 + 26 = 195 (too high)
31 + 65 + 73 + 26 = 195 (too high)
Checking combinations that might fit:
31 + 73 + 26 = 129 - 65 = 64 (close but not quite)
Then we get to:
Adding 31 again doesn't work it's complicated.  
Finally only this combination makes sense:
31 + 73 + 26 - 65 = 129 - 65 = 64
By adding number again the pattern gets more complex trying simpler.
Making a calculation faultily satisfies accurate goal that finally achieves simply.
Forming work singly means reducing:

- 69 - 90 + 12 = -9 (not 33)
- 90 - 69 + 12 = 33 (this works)
So the equation that equals 33 is 90 - 69 + 12.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 69 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 33 using the numbers 12, 69, and 90 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
12 + 69 + 90 = 171 (not 33)
90 + 69 - 12 = 147 (not 33)
69 + 90 - 12 = 147 (not 33)

<answer> 96 + 18 - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 39, 18, and 96 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
39 + 18 + 96 = 153 (This is too high)

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 62, 55, and 73 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
62 + 55 + 73 = 189 (not 66)
73 + 55 - 62 = 66 (this could work)
So, the equation that equals 66 is 73 + 55 - 62.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 55 - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 62, 55, and 73 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
62 + 55 + 73 = 189 (too high)
62 + 55 - 73 = 44 (too low)
We need to try other combinations. If we take numbers 62 and 73, subtract 55:
62 + 73 - 55 = 80 (still too high)
Next, I will leave 55 aside and use remaining combination systematically:
73 + 55 - 62 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 55 - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 10, 4, and 59. Let's try different combinations:
10 + 4 + 59 = 73 (not 65)
10 + 59 - 4 = 65 (this could be the solution)
Now I check if 10 + 59 - 4 equals 65, and indeed it does.

63 + 32 - 86 = -9 (not 55)
63 + 86 - 32 = 117 (not 55)
63 - 32 + 86 = 117 (not 55)
32 + 86 - 63 = 55 (this equals 55)
So, the correct equation is 32 + 86 - 63 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 86 - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 55 using the numbers 63, 32, and 86 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 63 - 32 - 86 = -55
- 63 - 32 + 86 = 117
- 63 + 32 - 86 = 9
- 63 + 32 + 86 = 181
None of these give us 55. Now let's try:
- 86 + 32 - 63 = 55
This combination works because 86 + 32 equals 118, and then subtracting 63 from 118 yields 55.
</think>
<answer> 86 + 32 - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 94, 65, and 77 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
94 - 65 + 77 = 106 (not 48)
77 - 65 + 94 = 106 (not 48)
94 + 65 - 77 = 82 (not 48)
94 + 77 - 65 = 106 (not 48)
65 + 77 - 94 = 48 (this works)
So the correct equation is 65 + 77 - 94 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 77 - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 64, 45, 71, and 52 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
64 + 45 + 71 + 52 = 232 (too high)
71 + 52 - 64 - 45 = 14 (too low)
64 + 71 - 45 - 52 = 38 (too low)
52 + 64 - 71 - 45 = -10 (too low)
45 + 71 + 52 - 64 = 104 (too high)
Instead, let's try:
(71 - 45) + (64 + 52) = 26 + 116 = 142 (too high)
Checking other possibility:
64 + (71 - 52) wouldn't use 45. But then we could try:
52 + 45 + 71 - 64 is 104 - 64 = 40 (to low). 
52 + 64 - 71 + 45 = 52 + 64 - 26 = 90
</think>
<answer> 52 + 64 - 71 + 45 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 64, 88, 53, and 1 to make 100. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations:
64 + 88 + 53 + 1 = 206 (This is too high)
64 + 88 + 1 - 53 = 90 (This is close but not quite there)
Let's try another combination:
64 + 88 - 53 + 1 = 90 (This is close but not quite there)
It looks like we need to use the numbers in a different way. Let's try multiplication and addition:
(88 / 4) + 64 + 53 + 1
But, how to get 4 from the numbers provided? Consider:
88 - 53 = 35, 35 - 64 = -29. This doesn't work.
Another combination:
(88 / 4) + 64 + 53 + 1
I realize 88 / 4 = 22, so
22 + (64 + 53 + 1) = 22 + 118 = 140, this isn't valid.
This cannot be solved through basic arithmetic with only arithmetic operators. Need to return to 90.
Lastly, 90 plus small modification would work:
64 + 88 - 53 + 1 = 90, so pairs could be validified as:
100 = 64 + 88 + 1 - 53
</think>
<answer> 64 + 88 + 1 - 53 </answer>

- 75 - 12 + 3 = 66 (not 37)
- 75 + 12 - 3 = 84 (not 37)
- 75 + 12 + 3 = 90 (not 37)
- 3 + 12 + 75 = 90 (not 37)
Now let's try some operations in a different order:
- 75 + (12 / 3) = 75 + 4 = 79 (not 37)
- (75 / 3) + 12 = 25 + 12 = 37 (this is it! )
</think>
<answer> (75 / 3) + 12 </answer>

97 - 19 - 30 - 18 = 30 (not 90)
97 - 19 - 30 + 18 = 76 (not 90)
97 - 19 + 30 - 18 = 90 (this looks promising)
So the equation is 97 - 19 + 30 - 18 = 90.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 19 + 30 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 92 using the numbers 67, 8, and 17 exactly once. Let's try different combinations of operations:

49 + 11 - 2 = 58 (this seems very promising, let's check the arithmetic)
49 + 11 - 2 does indeed equal 58.
</think>
<answer> 49 + 11 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 89 using the numbers 41, 7, 42, and 81 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:

54 + 43 - 19 = 78 (This seems to be right)
So the equation is 54 + 43 - 19 = 78.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 14 using the numbers 35, 20, 27, and 56 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
35 - 20 - 27 = -9 (not 14)
35 - 20 + 27 = 42 (not 14)
35 + 20 - 27 = 35 - 27 + 20 = 8 + 20 = 28 (not 14)
35 + 20 + 27 = 72 (not 14)
35 + 27 - 20 = 62 - 20 = 42 (not 14)
56 - 20 - 27 = 36 - 27 = 9 (not 14)
56 - 20 + 27 = 36 + 27 = 63 (not 14)
56 + 20 - 27 = 76 - 27 = 49 (not 14)
56 + 27 - 20 = 83 - 20 = 63 (not 14)
After trying these combinations, none of them equal 14. It seems I missed something. Let's review total options again:
Let me use different arithmetic combinations
35 - 20 - 27 = -9
imagine another possibility: 56 - (35 + 20 - 27) = 56 - 35 - 20 + 27
Not fitting any option separately. This will be:
56 - (35+27-20) in calculation. </think>
<answer> 56 - (35 + 27 - 20) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 42 using the numbers 78, 9, 50, and 79 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
78 - 9 - 50 - 79 = -60
78 - 9 - 50 + 79 = 98
78 - 9 + 50 - 79 = 20
78 + 9 - 50 - 79 = -42
78 + 9 - 50 + 79 = 106
78 + 9 + 50 - 79 = 58
78 + 9 + 50 + 79 = 216
78 + 9 - 50 + 79 = 96
78 + 9 + 50 - 79 = 58
None of these combinations yet resulted in 42. Let's try:
78 + 9 + 50 - 79 = 58 
Really, I see none of these worked. 
But if we rearrange, there's a way: 50 + 79 - 9 - 78
50 + 79 - 9 - 78 = 42

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 46 using the numbers 7, 19, 93, and 6 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
7 + 19 + 6 + 93 = 125 (This is too high)
93 + 19 + 7 + 6 = 125 (This is too high too)
93 + 6 + 19 + 7 = 125 (This is also too high)
Now, let's try another combination:
93 - 6 + 19 + 7 = 103 (This is too high)
93 - 19 + 6 + 7 = 107 (This is too high)
93 - 19 + 7 + 6 = 107 (This is too high too)
Alternatively:
7 + (19 * 6) - 93 = 7 + 114 - 93 = 31 (This is not 46)
7 + 19 - 6 + 93 = 7 + 19 - 6 + 93 = 114 (This is too high)
After further combinations and calculations:
7 * 19 - 93 + 6 = 133 - 93 + 6 = 46
Thus, we have found the correct combination.

71 + 31 + 45 - 34 = 113 (This is still too high)
71 + 31 - 45 + 34 = 81 (This is too low)
71 - 31 + 45 + 34 = 119 (This is too high)
71 - 31 - 45 + 34 = 29 (This is too low)
71 + 31 - 45 - 34 = 23 (This is too low)
71 - 31 + 45 - 34 = 51 (This is too low)
71 + 31 + 45 - 34 = 113 (This is too high)
Finally, I spotted the correct combination:
71 + 31 + 45 - 34 = 113, but we need to recheck it again. 71 + 31 - (45 - 34) = 71 + 31 - 11 = 111-( still high)
We wanna 91
71 + 31 - 45 + 34 = 91.

99 + 19 - 96 = 22 (doesn't work)
99 + 96 - 19 = 176 (doesn't work)
We missed the combination where multiplication and subtraction could work together:
(99 - 96) * 19 = 3 * 19 = 57
So the equation works out as: (99 - 96) * 19 = 57

32 + 70 + 34 = 136 (This is too high)
34 + 70 + 32 = 136 (This is too high too)
70 + 34 + 32 = 136 (This is also too high)
34 + 70 - 32 = 72 (This is close but not 68)
32 + 70 - 34 = 68 (Ah, this works. )

21 + 66 + 98 = 185 (not 53)
98 + 66 - 21 = 143 (not 53)
66 + 21 - 98 = -1 (not 53)
98 - 66 - 21 = 11 (not 53)
98 - 66 + 21 = 53 (this matches our target)
So the correct equation is 98 - 66 + 21 = 53. </think>

6 + 9 + 24 = 39 (not 13)
24 + 9 - 6 = 27 (not 13)
9 + 6 + 24 = 39 (not 13)
9 + 24 - 6 = 27 (not 13)
6 + 24 - 9 = 21 (not 13)
9 + 6 - 24 = -9 (not 13)
24 - 9 - 6 = 9 (not 13)
24 - 6 - 9 = 9 (not 13)
None of the above combinations work. Let's re-evaluate in another different order.
6 + (24 / 9) = 6 + 2.6667 (not an integer and not 13)
After rechecking all possible combinations it's clear mistakes in initial calculations. Justifications show all manual calculations or manual again revealing failure to achieve 13. But in deeds needed round.

- 91 - 35 + 66 = 91 + 31 = 122 (not 10)
- 91 + 35 - 66 = 126 - 66 = 60 (not 10)
- 91 + 35 + 66 = 126 + 66 = 192 (not 10)
- 35 + 66 - 91 = 101 - 91 = 10 (this works)
So the equation is 35 + 66 - 91 = 10.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 2, 13, and 73 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
2 + 13 + 73 = 88 (This is too high)
73 + 13 - 2 = 84 (This is also too high)
2 + 13 * 73 = 925 (This is way too high)
73 + 13 + 2 = 88 (This is too high)
2 * 13 + 73 = 99 (This is way too high)
2 * (73 - 13) = 124 (This is way too high)
2 * (73 + 13) = 180 (This is way too high)
After evaluating the combinations, the correct one is:
2 * (73 - 13) = 124 as it is reducing towards the number I need.
2 * (73 - 13) = 2 * 60 = 120 adjusting is needed.
Only close to 58 we value adjustment 2 * (73 - 13 - Expression created) 91 -73 = 18 thus  easier close position done. Correct scale temp lim setting misadjusted part putting value by reflective.

14 + 88 - 11 = 81 (not 91)
14 + 11 + 88 = 113 (not 91)
88 + 14 - 11 = 88 + 3 = 91
So, the equation that works is 88 + 14 - 11 = 91.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 63 using the numbers 69, 54, and 9 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 69 - 54 + 9 = 24 (too low)
- 69 + 54 - 9 = 114 (too high)
- 69 + (54 - 9) = 114 (too high)
- (69 - 54) + 9 = 15 (too low)
It seems the direct combination is not giving a result of 63. Let's reconsider the order and operations:
- (54 - 9) + 69 = 54 - 9 + 69 = 45 + 69 = 114
Even trial and error with combination doesn't get exact 63. Thinking the process again carefully the operations above didn’t solve properly hence checking again actual simple attention:

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 72, 54, and 58 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
72 - 54 + 58 = 76 (not 68)
58 + 72 - 54 = 76 (not 68)
We need to try other permutations:
72 - (54 + 58) = 72 - 112 = -40 (not 68)
Another possible try:
72 + 54 - 58 = 78 - 58 = 20 (not 68)
Trying one last combination:
72 + (54 - 58) = 72 + 6 = 78 (not 68)
I seem to be missing a tricky combination. But an overlooked simpler possibility:
(72 - 58) + 54 is effort, imbalanced outcomes:
58 + 54 = 112 for misplacement, 
neer the check. Done we have deduction that form figured prettier fitting. 
Summarily:
Better pathway simplified as feasible, logical:
(72 - 58) + 54 correctly fitting approximately reasonable..

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 23, 90, 71, and 2 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
23 + 90 + 71 + 2 = 187 (This is too high)
90 + 71 + 2 - 23 = 140 (This is also too high)
Let's try another combination:
90 + 23 - 71 + 2 = 44 (This is the correct equation)
</think>
<answer> 90 + 23 - 71 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 23, 90, 71, and 2 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
23 + 90 + 71 + 2 = 187 (This is too high)
90 + 71 + 2 - 23 = 140 (This is also too high)
Let's try another combination:
90 - 71 - 23 - 2 = -36 (This is not correct)
Now, let's try a different approach:
90 - 71 + 23 + 2 = 44
This works because 90 - 71 = 19, then 19 + 23 + 2 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 71 + 23 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 16, 65, 23, and 56 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
16 + 65 + 23 + 56 = 150 (This is too high)
65 + 23 + 56 - 16 = 121 (This is also high)
Let's try a mix of operations:
(65 - 56) * 23 + 16 = 0 + 16 = 16 (This is not 30)
(65 - 23) + (56 / 16) = 42 + 3. 5 (This is not 30 either)
Another possibility:
(65 - 56) + (23 * 16) = 9 + 368 = 377 (Too high again)
Finally a solution that works:
(65 - 56) + (23 + 16) = 9 + 39 = 48 (Incorrect again)
(56 - 23) + (65 + 16) = 33 + 81 = 114 (Too high)
Then I wound up:
(65 - 56) + (23 - 16) = 9 + 7 = 16 (Not right)
However later:
For finishing: (65 - 56) + (23 +16) = 9 + 39 = 48
(56-23) + (65+16) = 33 +81 =114
(65 - 23) + (16+56) = 42 + 72 = 114
Lastly Correct setup verified:
And right work: (65-23) + (16 +56) = 42 + 72 Actual calculation :
(65-23)+(56+16) slightly process fit got another correct simplest equation snippet:
16+23+56-65</ think>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 54 using the numbers 64, 23, and 95 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
64 + 23 + 95 = 182 (not 54)
95 - 64 - 23 = 95 - 87 = 8 (not 54)
64 - 95 + 23 = -51 + 23 = -28 (not 54)
64 + 95 - 23 = 159 - 23 = 136 (not 54)
23 + 95 - 64 = 119 - 64 = 55 (not 54)
23 + 64 - 95 = 87 - 95 = -8 (not 54)
Rechecking reveals a critical oversight. Let’s try fundamental operations but rearranged carefully, knowing:
95 - 64 = 31
Then 31 + 23 = 54, which exactly matches the need.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 64 + 23 </answer>

92 + 9 - 10 = 81 (not 91)
92 + 9 + 10 = 111 (not 91)
92 + (9 - 10) = 91 This combination works since 9 - 10 = -1, and 92 + (-1) = 91.
</think>
<answer> 92 + (9 - 10) </answer>

So the equation that works is 56 + 21 - 8 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 21 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 74, 18, 91, and 38 exactly once. Let's try combining them with basic operations:
74 - 18 - 38 + 91 = 79 - 38 + 91 = 41 + 91 = 132 - This is close but not 73.
74 - (18 + 91 / 38) = 74 - (18 + 0. 421) = 74 - 18. 421 = 55. 579
Seems incorrect and complex, re-evaluating numbers operations.
By observation - 91 - (74 + 38) = 91 - 112 = -21
Even further from 73, then re-adjusting to correct
74 - 18 + 91 - 38 = 56then workaround without overstatement
Focus a simplified working of major grouped simplifying:
74 - 91 + 38 + 18 = -21still not right explicitly

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 66, 41, and 23 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 66 - 41 - 23 = 0 (not 48)
- 66 - 41 + 23 = 48 (this could be the solution)
So the equation that works is 66 - 41 + 23 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 41 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 88, 35, 57, and 18 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
88 - 35 - 57 + 18 = 18 (not 48)
88 - 35 + 57 - 18 = 98 (not 48)
88 + 35 - 57 - 18 = 48 (this works)
So the equation is 88 + 35 - 57 - 18 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 88 + 35 - 57 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 21 using the numbers 66, 17, 35, and 97 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
66 - 17 - 35 + 97 = 111 (doesn't work)
66 - 17 - (97 - 35) = -43 (doesn't work)
66 - (17 + 35) + 97 = 101 (doesn't work)
(97 - 35) + (66 - 17) = 102 (doesn't work)
66 - (97 - 35 - 17) = 21 (works)
</think>
<answer> 66 - (97 - 35 - 17) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 57 using the numbers 33, 79, and 55 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
33 + 79 + 55 = 167 (This is too high)
79 + 55 - 33 = 101 (This is also too high)
33 + 55 - 79 = 9 (This is too low)
Trying another combination:
79 - 55 + 33 = 57
This combination works because 79 - 55 equals 24, and then adding 33 to that gives us 57.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 55 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 17, 60, and 1. Let's try different combinations:

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 28 using the numbers 70, 21, and 21. Let's try different combinations:
70 + 21 + 21 = 112 (This is too high)
70 + 21 - 21 = 70 (This is not 28)
21 + 21 + 70 = 112 (This is the same as above)
70 - 21 - 21 = 28 (This looks promising)
</think>
<answer> 70 - 21 - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 31, 76, and 63 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
31 + 76 + 63 = 169 (this is too high)
76 + 63 - 31 = 108 (this is also too high)

80 + 36 - 51 = 65. This seems to be the right combination.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 36 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 51, 36, and 80 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
51 + 36 + 80 = 167 (This is too high)
51 + 36 - 80 = 7 (This is too low)
51 + (80 - 36) = 95 (This is too high too)
80 + 36 - 51 = 65. This combination works because 80 + 36 = 116 and 116 - 51 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 36 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 40, 48, and 10 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
40 + 48 + 10 = 98 (which is too high)
40 + 48 - 10 = 80 (which is too high)
48 + 40 - 10 = 80 (which is too high)
48 - 40 + 10 = 18 (which is too low)
40 - 48 + 10 = 2 (which is too low)
40 + 48 / 10 = 48.4 (not an integer)
Trying by addition and subtraction only we did not find the answer. As a next try, consider multiplication with addition which also didn't work out. One missing mathematical operation task is using subtraction aggressively and rethinking addition in a way to fit 78 completely, 40 + (48 - 10) doesn't appear directly. For risk check, re-evaluating simple operations resulted: Consider distinct path favouring calculation difference next direct 1 methodical way accordingly.

6 + 8 + 63 = 77 (this is too high)
63 + 8 - 6 = 65 (this is also too high)
63 - 8 - 6 = 49 (this is too low)
63 - 8 + 6 = 61 (this equals 61, which is what we want)
</think>
<answer> 63 - 8 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 25 using the numbers 20, 32, and 77 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 67 using the numbers 87, 68, 84, and 2 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
87 + 68 + 84 + 2 = 241 (This is too high)
87 + 68 + 84 - 2 = 239 (This is still too high)
87 + 68 - 84 - 2 = 79 (This is too high)
87 + 68 - 84 + 2 = 73 (This is too low)
87 - 68 + 84 + 2 = 105 (This is too high)
87 - 68 + 84 - 2 = 101 (This is too high)
87 - 68 - 84 + 2 = -63 (This is too low)
Trying another set:
68 + 84 + 2 - 87 = 67 (This works)
</think>
<answer> 68 + 84 + 2 - 87 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 18 using the numbers 35, 3, and 14 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 60 using the numbers 84, 54, and 14 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 84 - 54 - 14 = 16 (not 60)
- 84 - 54 + 14 = 44 (not 60)
- 84 + 54 - 14 = 124 (not 60)
- 84 + 54 + 14 = 152 (not 60)
- 54 + 14 - 84 = -16 (not 60)
- 54 - 14 + 84 = 124 (not 60)
- 14 + 54 - 84 = -6 (not 60)
- 14 + 84 - 54 = 44 (not 60)
Hmm, nothing that works directly, so let me try tweaking combinations more:
84 - (54 - 14) equals 44 (not 60)
54 + (84 - 14)), equals 124 (not 60)
14 + 84 - 54, equals 44 (not 60)
How about this:
84 + 54 / 14 = 84 + 3.857 = 87.857 (not 60)
None actually added 54 and subtracted 84, or inversely 84(54-14) found as a historically worked example seems incorrect - understanding learning eq. checking properly
54 + (84 - 14), or having seen clearly only 54+(84/14) 54+6 remains to verify confirm easily 
TEST : as understood in loop correct one aiter hold 
Therefore allocating step properly 
(54 + (84 / 14)) = 84- 54+ (60+ VALID APYNALLY WITH REALTY CORRECTIONS.. special case cases correctly verified) Above verified :</think>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 79 using the numbers 54, 49, and 74 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
54 + 49 + 74 = 177 (This is too high)
74 + 49 - 54 = 69 (This is too low)
54 + 74 - 49 = 79 (This is the correct equation)

<answer> 54 + 74 - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 23 using the numbers 68, 19, and 64 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
68 - 19 - 64 = -45
68 - 19 + 64 = 113
68 + 19 - 64 = 23 This last combination equals 23, which is what we want.
</think>
<answer> 68 + 19 - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 23 using the numbers 68, 19, and 64 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
68 - 19 - 64 = -21 (not 23)
68 - 19 + 64 = 113 (not 23)
68 + 19 - 64 = 23 (this could be the answer)
So, the correct equation is 68 + 19 - 64 = 23.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 95 using the numbers 28, 16, and 83, each exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 83 + 16 + 28 = 127 (which is not 95)
- 83 + 28 - 16 = 95 (which is exactly 95)
So the equation that works is 83 + 28 - 16 = 95.

94 + 88 - 36 = 146 (This is also too high)
94 + 36 - 88 = 42 (This is too high)
88 + 36 - 94 = 28 (Very close, let's try another combination)
36 + 88 - 94 = 30
</think>
<answer> 36 + 88 - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 92, 91, and 31 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
92 + 91 - 31 = 152 (not 30)
92 - 91 + 31 = 32 (not 30)
92 + 31 - 91 = 32 (not 30)
91 + 31 - 92 = 30 (this works)
</think>
<answer> 91 + 31 - 92 </answer>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 61 using the numbers 67, 55, and 73 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
67 + 55 - 73 = 122 - 73 = 49 (not 61)
67 + 73 - 55 = 140 - 55 = 85 (not 61)
67 - 55 + 73 = 12 + 73 = 85 (not 61)
55 + 73 - 67 = 128 - 67 = 61 (this works)
</think>
<answer> 55 + 73 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 61 using the numbers 67, 55, and 73 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
67 + 55 - 73 = 122 - 73 = 49 (not 61)
73 + 55 - 67 = 128 - 67 = 61 (this works)

87 + 95 - 40 = 142 - 40 = 102 (not 48)
95 + 40 - 87 = 135 - 87 = 48 (this works)
So the equation that equals 48 is 95 + 40 - 87.
</think>
<answer> 95 + 40 - 87 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 87, 95, and 40 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
87 + 95 - 40 = 142 - 40 = 102 (too high)

<answer> 95 + 40 - 87 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 95 using the numbers 59, 58, 31, and 53 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
59 + 58 + 31 + 53 = 201 (This is too high)
59 + 58 - 31 + 53 = 129 (This is also too high)
59 + 58 - (31 - 53) = 137 (Still too high)
Let's try a different combination:
(59 + 58) - 31 + 53 = 135 (That's a bit too high)
Another way could be:
59 + (58 - 31) + 53 = 89 (Too low, but very close)
Finally, a different arrangement:
59 + 58 + (53 - 31) = 169  (Still wrong)
Having closer taken into consideration finally:
59 + (58 + 53 - 31) = 179 (Approaching non-aim target)
Lastly, a mix would see:
59 + 58 - 53 + 31 =95  - perfectly fitting target is met.

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 98, 56, and 36 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
98 - 56 - 36 = 3
98 - 56 + 36 = 82
98 + 56 - 36 = 118
98 + 56 + 36 = 190
None of these work. Let's try:
98 + 56 / 36:
56 / 36 is approximately 1.555, so adding it to 98 doesn't work as well.
98 - (56 / 36):
Again, not it. 
Let's try calculation again more straightforward way currently the closest is 
 98 + 56 - 36 = 118 not works, Now will double check 
98 + 36 - 56 = 78

<answer> 98 + 36 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 54 using the numbers 90, 88, and 27 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
90 - 88 = 2
90 + 88 = 178
27 + 2 = 29
27 - 2 = 25
90 + 88 + 27 = 185 (this is too large)
90 + 88 - 27 = 151 (this is too large)
90 + 88 / 27 = 102.22 (not an integer, so invalid)
88 + 27 - 90 = 25 (this is too small)
No combination of these operations gives us 54. I overlooked recursive or advanced operations. Let's try multiplying and subtracting in another way:
90 - (88 - 27) = 90 - 61 = 29 (this is wrong too)
(90 - 88) * 27 = 2 * 27 = 54! This satisfies the criteria.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 88) * 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 22 using the numbers 75, 9, and 88 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:

75 - 9 + 88 = 154 (not 22)
9 + 88 - 75 = 12 (not 22)
75 + 9 - 88 = 6 (not 22)
75 + 88 - 9 = 154 (not 22)
75 + 9 + 88 = 172 (not 22)
9 + 88 + 75 = 172 (not 22)
Then finally another wrong abandon began us 
9 + 75 - 88 = -4 (no...)
reading backwards again
88 + 9 - 75 = 12
Then switch minds; thus 
88 + 75 - 9 = 154
88 + 9 - 75 =12
