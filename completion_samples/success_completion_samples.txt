<think> Clearly, we are dealing with the numbers 84, 18, and 3. Let's start by looking at each number and thinking about how to combine them to approach 30.
Given that 30 is very close to 84/2, it could mean we should consider division in the formulation.
Multiplying 18 and 3 would give us 54, much larger than 30, so let's skip that for now.
Using 18 and dividing by 3 obviously gives us 6, not what we need.
Now remember 84 is the largest number, so we should think about subtracting smaller numbers from 84 to reach closer to our answer.
Subtracting 18 from 84 gives us 66, and dividing this by 3 would give us:
66 / 3 = 22, still not 30.
To get closer to 30, we should try subtracting 18 from another large number and see where that gets us:
(84 - 18) / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22.
Clearly, 22 is too far from our target of 30, so we need to try using 18 in a different way.
Now, let's consider using the numbers in a different order and think about subtraction and multiplication:
Try 18 * 3 = 54 and then subtract 24 from 84. We need to find a number that when subtracted from 84 gives 30.
84 - 54 = 30. So if we do 84 - (18 * 3), we get 30.
There we go! That's the equation we are looking for.</think>
<answer> (84 - (18 * 3)) </answer>

==============
<think>Firstly, let's consider if we can create 79 directly using two of the given numbers. The number 72 is close but not quite there. Maybe the equation involves addition or subtraction of 7 or 8, but 27, 21, and 41 seem too large to achieve that directly. We can also evaluate division and multiplication, but these operations typically lead to numbers under 20 or above 80, which doesn't help us reach 79.</think>
<think>Given that the target number is far from the nearest starting number (27), let's work on manipulating numbers to get close. I notice that 27 + 41 = 68, which is far from 79 and too low. But if we explore the operations with our chosen numbers, we may find the solution.</think>
<think>Let's consider using 21 and 72 in conjunction with 41. An operation that multiplies or divides 21 or 41 could potentially lead us closer to 79. But we'll start from 21 and add to it using the remaining numbers.</think>
<think>Let's try adding 41 and see if we can reach closely to 79. That's 21 + 41 = 62. We need 17 more to make 79. Now, consider the possibility of reducing our goal by dividing or using the remaining numbers. We cannot divide 72, but we can subtract from 72.</think>
<think>Notice that 72 - 41 = 31, and if we add 27, this gives 31 + 27 = 58. Now we need 21 more to reach 79, which is exactly the sum of 21 and 72 - 41.</think>
</think>
<answer> (21 + 72 - 41) + 27 </answer>
</answer>

==============
<think> Since we want to arrive at 30 and given the numbers 24, 65, and 59, intuitively, we need to utilize some subtraction. The number 65 is significantly higher than 30, so it seems like it might subtract a substantial amount from it at one point to make 30. Given 59 is close to 30, we could consider the feasibility of it as well. </think>
Let's start by looking at the possibility of subtracting 59 from 65 to get a reasonable value to work with.
<think> Adding 24 to the result of subtracting 59 from 65 should keep us moving towards our target of 30. </think>
<think> If we perform 65 - 59 = 6 first, then adding 24 to this result: 6 + 24 = 30, this would give us our desired result. Hence, the equation is: 65 - 59 + 24 = 30. </think>
<answer> 65 - 59 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication and division first since these can yield larger numbers (like 72) that can be closer to 12. The numbers we have are 72, 2, and 3. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6, and then dividing 72 by 6 gives us 12. Thus, the equation could be 72 / (2 * 3) which equals 12. </think>
<answer> 72 / (2 * 3) </answer>

==============
<think> Since the target is 47, and I am aiming to use each number, 33, 84, 38, and 34 only once, I'll try different permutations of the numbers and operations. Let's start with multiplication and division since they can significantly increase or decrease values to make the target more achievable.</think>
<think> Let's consider the pattern with 84: if we try to use this in conjunction with another number, like 33 and 38, we should see what multiplication would yield. 84 * 38 = 3212, which is already large and far from our target. Dividing 84 by any of these numbers will not help as the results will be under 47. </think>
<think> Let's move to operations between 33 and 38. Adding or subtracting these numbers yields: 38 - 33 = 5 or 33 - 38 = -5. We want the result to fit into how we can use the remaining numbers, 84 and 34, to reach 47. </think>
<think> So, we need to somehow manipulate 33, 38, and 84 with 34 to get 47. Adding 34 to 33 + 38 = 71 and then dividing by 84 does not work since we only have one number 84 to divide into 71+34. </think>
<think> Now let's try another combination using operations. If we divide 84 by 34, we get 2.47, which is not an integer and hence not useful here. Let's look at another combination considering subtraction: if we subtract 38 from 84, we get 46, close to our target but slightly above. We need to make 47, so an adjustment is required. </think>
<think> I believe the path is to take 38 from 84 and then use the subtraction approach with 33 and 34. If we subtract 33 from 34, we get 1, which is not immediately aligned, but subtracting 1 from 46 gives us 45, not quite there. Consequently, we need to find how 84 - 38 = 46 can be adjusted by 33 and 34 to be 47.</think>
<think> I realize adding 33 to 46 doesn't quite work. But subtracting 33 from 46 (another approach for another problem) would give us steps where I can align the remaining numbers. 34 is nearly equivalent to subtracting 34 from 46. Thus, (84 - 38) + (34 - 33) = 46+1 = 47. </think>
<answer> (84 - 38) + (34 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> 
Firstly, I need to create an equation using the numbers 72, 5, and 49 that results in 28, and each number can only be used once. I'll start by analyzing which combination of arithmetic operations might help. The number 72 seems too large to get down to 28 using multiplication or division with 49 or 5. Therefore, I will focus on using subtraction and addition.
</think>
<answer>
(72 - 49) + 5
</answer>
Let me work through the steps:
<think>
(72 - 49) + 5 = 23 + 5
</think>
<answer>
(72 - 49) + 5 = 23 + 5 = 28
</answer>
Therefore, the final equation is <answer>(72 - 49) + 5</answer>.

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 83 using the numbers 98, 92, and 77, with each number used only once and basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with the numbers, I see that 98 is the largest number, so I should consider what it could be subtracted by or added to. Subtracting or dividing by smaller numbers could get me closer to 83.
First, let's try to use addition. If I can find a way to get 98 - something close to 83, I might be on to something.
98 - 92 = 6, 98 - 77 = 21, 92 - 77 = 15
None of these closely match 83. Then let's try a tricky addition.
98 - 92 = 6 and if I use 92 + 77, I could get 75 + 9, 75 + some other numbers, etc.
Let's try: 77 + 92 = 169 - 86 = 83, but 86 isn't in the list of numbers.
What if I consider multiplication with one of the numbers:
(92 * 1) + 77 = 92 + 77 = 169 / 2 = 84.5 not 83.
Then, let's consider if combining subtraction and addition or multiplication works. If I first consider taking away 92 from 98, and then use the result with 77:
98 - 92 = 6, 6 + 77 = 83
This is the right path. </think>
<answer>(98 - 92) + 77</answer>

==============
<think> First, I would like to simplify the consideration of multiplication and division because they significantly affect the outcome and are more likely to achieve a precise sum when applied to the smallest remaining numbers. That leaves addition and subtraction. If I were to consider the subtraction first, I might want to reduce the larger numbers to make reaching 70 feasible. </think>
Given the numbers [5, 17, 84, 8], subtracting the smallest number (5) from the largest (84) leaves 79. If only addition is considered, adding 8 would bring us close to 70, making 84 - 5 + 8. This doesn't directly solve the problem, but it gets very close. I can adjust by alternately using subtraction and addition.</think>
<think> Considering the equation 84 - 5 + 8 - 17 = 70, the steps are as follows:
1. Start with 84.
2. Subtract 5, we get 79.
3. Add 8, making it 84 + 8 = 92.
4. Subtract 17, we obtain the final sum of 70.
This adheres to the rule of using each number exactly once and follows the mathematical operations as desired.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 5 + 8 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 3 and 77. While 77 is considerably bigger than 64, adding or subtracting 3 could be a starting point. Multiplying 3 by any number would make the result larger, and dividing 77 by 3 would not necessarily reduce the number to 64. Let's begin with the subtraction idea: 77 - 3 = 74. Now, we need to get the remaining 10 to reach 64. Substituting 74 with 10 and then subtracting will get us closer to 64: 74 - 10 = 64. </think>
<answer> (77 - 3) - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 51, 33, and 57. We need to combine them using arithmetic operations to achieve the result 27. 33 seems to be the easiest to use in this case because it's a neat round number. So I will use addition and subtraction with the other two numbers to get to 27. </think>
Since we need to get 27 and 33 is close, let's see if we can use 33 in any way to help us reach the result.
<think> I need to subtract from 33 to get 27, as 33 - 6 = 27. Now I need to find if I can generate 6 using the other numbers, 51 and 57. </think>
Now, let's look at using 51 and 57.
<think> I can subtract 51 from 57 to make 6. So the expression becomes 57 - 51 = 6. Now, putting this all together the equation looks like this:
33 - (57 - 51) = 27
</think>
<answer> 33 - (57 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the provided numbers [87, 18, 29] using basic arithmetic operations to make the expression equal to 40. I'll start by examining the numbers closely to find a combination that might work.
I notice that 87 and 18 do not make 40 easily when combined directly. I think I might need to use 29 in some operation. The numbers 87 and 18 can be manipulated by subtracting 29 from 87, resulting in 58, but then I need to subtract another 18 to get down to the target of 40.
So, this might be a good equation: 58 - 18 = 40.
But we are restricted to using each number only once. Therefore, let's see if 87 can be transformed in another way, maybe subtracting 29 from 87 and then subtracting the result of 18:
(87 - 29) - 18 = 40.
This satisfies the requirement of using each number only once and equals 40.
</think>
<answer>(87 - 29) - 18</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's think about what we need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide by to get from these numbers to 56. Given the numbers 19, 43, and 80, it seems we might need to use division or subtraction to adjust the total down. Multiplication or addition could make the numbers too large or too small.</think>
<think>Considering 43 as a significant starting point, if we can bring the other numbers close to 56, we might consider 80 to be our target after some manipulation. 
If we subtract 19 from 43 first, we get 24. Now, we need to get to 56, so we need to add 32 to 24, which is achieved by 80 - 48, but 48 is not one of the original numbers. 
Instead, let's think of the inverse: to get from 24 to 56 in one step, we need to add 32. We can see that 32 is 4 times 8, and 8 can be generated from 80 - 72, but none of these are part of the initial list either. 
So, let's think about just getting 43 to be close to 56 with the remaining operation. </think>
<think>80 - 43 = 37, which is not quite 56, but we can still use it. Now, to get from 37 closer to 56, we can try using the 19. 56 - 37 = 19. This can be seen as multiplying 19 by 1, but we have no other number to do this directly, so we'll use division or another approach.
If we examine 80 - (43 * 1) = 37 again in a different context, we see that we can invert the equation, thus returning to our original numbers in another method. Doing (80 - 43) + 19 = 56.
</think>
<answer>(80 - 43) + 19</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the three numbers available: 88, 98, and 57. The goal is to produce a result of 67 using basic arithmetic operations, with one of each of these digits plus the operations allowed. Let's try some combinations starting with subtraction first, as it often simplifies large numbers quickly. </think>
<think> Subtracting 57 from 98 gives us 41. Now we have 88 and 41 to work with. If we subtract 41 from 88, we get 47. However, we need 67, not 47. </think>
<think> Trying addition, if I add 57 to 98, I get 155, which is far from 67. As multiplication and division ensure the number we get is either a large or a small fraction of the starting number, I will focus on the addition and subtraction paths further. </think>
<think> Moving on, if I try another subtraction option: since 98 is quite close to 88, I might need to think about adding or multiplying strategically. Combining 57 and 88 with addition or multiplication does not simplify effectively towards 67. </think>
<think> Another approach is to think about what combination of operations would lead to 67 directly. Notice that operating with subtraction will help in creating the final result more efficiently. If I try to use 88 and 98 directly, I can consider 98 minus 88 equals 10. Now, if I add 57 to 10, I get 67. </think>
<answer> 98 - 88 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to arrive at the number 84 using the numbers 90, 57, and 51. Let's first try multiplication and division, as they have more significant effects when used with the available numbers.
Multiplying 90 by any of the other two numbers would give a product much larger than 84. Sure, 90 * 57 = 5130 and 90 * 51 = 4590 are far beyond 84.
Next, let's consider division. If I divide 90 by 57 or 51, the results will be less than 2, which certainly won't help reach 84. In fact, 90 / 51 and 90 / 57 both give numbers too low to interact with 57 or 51 to reach our target.
Multiplication and division by these numbers aren't yielding results that bring us close to 84. Let's then reconsider addition and subtraction, as these operations can bring us closer to 84 in a manageable way.
Adding or subtracting 57 or 51 from 90 or 51 does not bring us to 84. For instance, 90 - 57 = 33, 90 - 51 = 39, 57 + 90 = 147, and 51 + 90 = 141.
Let's try combining operations in another way. Given that 90 is the largest number, we might try 'subtracting' 57 and 'adding' 51, and check if this combination can lead us to 84.
</think>
<think> Performing the combination 90 - 57 + 51 gives 84. Now I confirm that this aligns with the equation we need.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 57) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will take a look at the numbers provided: 38, 59, and 12. My goal is to get 85 using each of these numbers exactly once, and only using basic arithmetic operations. I should note that there may be multiple solutions, but I will focus on a logical sequence that reflects a straightforward path to the solution. 
An obvious first step would be to check the sum of all three numbers as the numbers are not large and two might help get close to 85. Their sum is 38 + 59 + 12 = 109, which is not 85 but is closer. The difference is 24, which might be achieved by subtraction. 
I will start by substraction 12 from the sum. </think>
<answer>(38 + 59) - 12</answer>
This gives us 97 - 12, which is 85.</answer>
</think>
<answer> (38 + 59) - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I will first examine what operations need to be performed on the numbers to equal 97. Given 38 and 66, adding or subtracting these numbers do not seem to lead to 97. Multiplying them results in 2,448, which is way too high, and dividing them results in 0.53846, which is too low. Therefore, multiplication and division by these numbers don't work.
Considering 7, if I add it to 38, I get 45, which isn't close to 97. If I subtract 7 from 38, I get 31, which is also not correct.
Next, I think about how 7 and 66 could be used together. Multiplying 7 by 66 gives me 462, which is much too high. Subtracting 7 from 66 gives me 59, which is closer but still far from the target of 97.
Since I need to reach 97 from 59, I should try to use subtraction or addition to adjust, but my available number is 38. If I add 38 to 59, I get 97. Therefore, one equation that satisfies the condition is 38 + 59 - 66 = 97.
</think>
<answer>38 + (66 - 7)</answer>

==============
<think> We are using the numbers 19, 14, and 87 and need to arrive at 54. First, let's consider if we can use any of these numbers as part of a subtraction or combination for quicker results.
Given the numbers, subtraction might not be immediately useful as it would not be straightforward to get close to 54, even when using -87.
Multiplication and division on these individual numbers also don't seem to be leading us to 54 easily.
Let's then consider combinations. If we use 19 and 14, their sum is 33, and then subtracting from 87 gives us 54. So, 87 - 19 - 14 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 19 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers [11, 58, 49] to create an equation that equals 96. I notice that 58 and 49 are quite large numbers, so they might be the target or a part of it.
Let's consider if multiplication of 58 and 49 would lead us close to or exactly equal 96. Calculating 58 * 49:
58 * 49 = 2882, which is far from 96.
Next, let's consider potential subtractions with these numbers. Let's consider:
58 - 49 = 9.
This much closer, but still far from 96. Let's see if we can use the 11 and try other combinations:
11 + 85 = 96, but 85 is not a number closest to 58 or 49.
We need to consider division. Let's explore:
58 / 49 = 1.183... This doesn't help as it's not close to a whole number.
Thus, we need to use the remaining number 11 and see if we can combine it with the other numbers:
(58 - 49) + 11 could potentially work.
58 - 49 = 9.
9 + 11 = 20, which is not equal to 96.
Now let's arrange them in a way where a different combination could work:
Considering (58 + 49) - 11 for now, because we need to get to 96.
(58 + 49) = 107.
107 - 11 = 96.
This is the break we needed.
</think>
<answer>(58 + 49) - 11</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by considering the numbers and the arithmetic operations. I notice that the final result needs to be 88, and we need to use all three numbers: 57, 16, and 47 exactly once. 
Working on these, I recall that multiplication could yield a large number quickly. Let's see if multiplying 57 and 16 gives a number close to or exactly 47 times some other number.
\[ 57 \times 16 = 912 \]
This is too large, so I need to reduce the result. 
Now, let's consider dividing instead. If I divide 912 by 11, I get:
\[ 912 / 11 \approx 82.91 \]
This is far from our target of 88, so a different approach is needed.
I recall that 47 could be subtracted or added to the division result, or we can think in reverse. What if I take 47, multiply it by the fraction of 16/57, and adjust accordingly?
\[ \text{Let} \quad 47 \times \frac{16}{57} = x \]
Calculating the value of x:
\[ x = 47 \times \frac{16}{57} = \frac{752}{57} \approx 13.14 \]
I need a number close to 55-13. 14 = 41. Now, taking the difference between 88 and 41 to get 47.
Using the equation:
\[ 88 = 47 + (57 - 16) \]
Now, let's express this in the required format.
</think>
<answer> (57 - 16) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll go through the numbers: 46, 48, and 39. I want to arrive at 37 using basic arithmetic operations on these numbers.
I can easily see that 46 + 48 doesn't yield 37. Moving on.
48 - 46 gives 2, which isn't useful for our goal. Let's try a different approach.
48 - 39 = 9. Now I have 9, 46, and 48 to work with, and 37 is our target.
46 - 9 = 37. Now I have arrived at 37. Let's confirm the whole expression.
(The expression would be 46 - (48 - 39)). </think>
<answer> 46 - (48 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers that are closer to 55. Here we are looking for a combination that equals 55 using the numbers 66, 70, and 51.
Using subtraction, if we take 70 from 66, we get 4. So, (70 - 66) = 4. 
Now we need to get from 4 to 55. Adding 51 to 4 does not work as it gives us 55.
If we use a different approach, we can realize that (70 - 66 = 4). Now, to reach 55, we can try another combination. Since we can't use 70, let's try to find something with 51 to get us closer.
Considering multiplication or division with 51, dividing 51 by 51 equals 1 and adding this to 4 does not give us 55.
Lastly, let's consider the possibility of using simple addition or subtraction. With 51 being larger and 66 closer to our target, we can look at subtraction:
(70 - 66) + 51 = 4 + 51 = 55. </think>
<answer>(70 - 66) + 51</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need an equation that can reach 66 using the available numbers: 27, 3, and 90. A good strategy here is to use multiplication or division to get closer to 66, since dealing with 66 itself is too high for our available numbers. Let's multiply 90 by some number to reach this value. If I multiply 90 by 2, it equals 180, which is quite far from 66. If I multiply 90 by 1. 5, I get 135, still not close enough but moving in the right direction. Multiplying by 1. 133333... is too precise. Let's try another route.
Since 90 is pretty large, using it as a base, I could subtract or add other numbers to reach 66. If I divide 90 by 1. 428571... (which is 3/2), I get 64, which is close. Now, if I subtract 3, I get 61, and if I subtract 27, I get 34. That's nearer to 66, but still not there.
So let's see if I can make another small adjustment. What if I add 3 to 64 (i.e., 90/2. 667) and then add 2? That would be 65. And to reach 66, I just need to add 1. Now, 1 cannot be made from our numbers, so I need to think of a way to get 65 and then add 1. It seems multiplication and division are leading me astray. Let's switch to addition. If I take 90 and add 3, I get 93. Now, I can subtract 27 to reach 66: 93 - 27 = 66. </think>
<answer> 90 + 3 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll need to figure out how to use the numbers 64, 8, and 94 to get the result of 38. 
Considering the target number we need to achieve is 38, I think one effective way is to use the largest number (94) to reduce the target number closer to 38. Let's think of using subtraction here.
Using 94 - 64 gives us 30. Now, to get the final result of 38, we will need to add 8 to 30. This fits all the given constraints - we are using each number only once and performing valid arithmetic operations.
So the equation will be: (94 - 64) + 8.
</think>
<answer>(94 - 64) + 8</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should recognize that the result we need to achieve is 59, which is quite far from the smallest number, 1. Since 20 is the largest number and has both addition and multiplication potential, I should start by examining how 20 can be used to reach closer to 59.
20 can be multiplied by 3 to yield 60, which is just 1 short of 59. But that will require 59/3 which isn't an integer, so it's out. We should consider doing 20 * 3 and then subtracting 1 from the result.
1 * 3 equals 3. Subtracting 1 from 3 leaves us with 2.
Therefore, 20 * 3 - 1 = 59.
So, the equation is 20 * 3 - 1.
</think>
<answer>20 * 3 - 1</answer>

<think> For our numbers [42, 83, 23], the final result we need is 18. The first number 42 seems big enough that it can help get us closer to 18, and the other two numbers are small enough to fine-tune the result.
Let's consider the relationship between the numbers. By inspection, 83 - 42 - 23 would give us something between 0 and 18. We need 18, so we can use multiplication or division to scale it up. 

Now, we see we need to reduce the number to 18, and 83-42-23 = 18. So, we need to make this equation simpler using the available operations and numbers.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 42 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers: 68, 53, and 91. To get to 76, we need to perform some basic arithmetic operations. 
Since 91 is the largest and furthest from 76, it's possible we might need to take 91 away to get close to 76. But 91 - 76 = 15, so that wouldn't help.
Next, let's consider subtraction between 68 and 53. This gives us 15, but again, we need to get to 76.
What if we tried using multiplication and division? Considering 68 * 1 = 68, 68 / 1 = 68, and 91 / 1 = 91. We can use 91 to reach our target, but we'll need to find a way to add or subtract to get to 76. 
Let's see:
- If we divide 91 by 1 (which is 91) and then multiply by 1 (which is 1), we get 91 * 1 = 91. So, we're still far from 76.
- If we take 68 and divide by 1 (which is 68) and then add 53 (which is 53 + 68 = 121), we're still not in the right ballpark. But 68 / 1 = 68, and 68 + 53 = 121.
Now we see that 68 + 53 = 121, but we need to get to 76. This means we need to subtract 45 from 121 to reach 76.
We know that 91 can't be directly used here since it's much larger. Let's think of other operations. Perhaps we can subtract 68 or 53 from 91. 
If we perform 91 - 68 = 23, that's not 76. Let's try 91 - 53 = 38. Still not there.
Finally, let's combine these into one equation: 91 - 68 = 23, then 23 + 53 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 68 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the equation which should use only the numbers 27, 38, and 78 once and lead to the result 67. 
Let's start with simple operations combining these numbers. One approach is to see if adding or subtracting these numbers can almost equal 67.
Combining 78 - 38 = 40, but I need to reach 67, so this isn't quite right. Now, considering multiplication or division with the remaining number 27, as in 38 * 27/27 = 38, another 27 isn't allowed. 
Next, let's think of combining 27 and 38 with subtraction or addition. If I add 27 and 38, it equals 65, which is closer to 67. Then I need two additional units to reach 67. Maybe the remaining 27 can help this way: 65 + 27 - 38 = 64 + 27 - 38, but this isn't equal to 67. 
Instead, let's experiment with more complex combinations. Adding 27 and 38 gives 65. We could consider 65 plus some operation with 27. Now, 65 / 27 isn't an integer, but 65 - 27 = 38. Plugging this into the equation, we get 65 - 27 + 27 = 65, and adding -27 (which is not allowed) or rearranging like 65 + (27 - 27) = 65 again doesn't help.
Thinking about multiplication and division, 78 * 38/27 = 10868/27, which is not a whole number, so I can't directly use this. Let's try (78/27) * 38 = 38 * 38/27 = 1444/27, again not a whole number.
Lastly, a recombination is needed. Let's try a different numerical addition and subtraction approach: (78-27) + 38 = 51 + 38 = 89, which is too high; subtracting should get us closer. Let's try (78-38) + 27 = 40 + 27 = 67, perfect!
</think>

<answer> (78 - 38) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> The target is 89 and we have the numbers 96, 73, 29, 95. We need to use all numbers exactly once and only the basic arithmetic operations are allowed. 96 and 95 are higher than 89, 73 and 29 are more on the lower side, so there may be a combination for reaching 89. First, consider what subtraction or addition between 96 and 95 gives us close to or equal to 89:
96 - 95 = 1,
95 - 96 = -1.
Neither of these get us close to 89. Next, we should consider multiplication. Notice 73 * 2 = 146 and 73 * 1 = 73 where both are too large for our needs. Now, let's consider 73 divided by 29 or 29 divided by 73:
73 / 29 is approximately 2.517 and 29 / 73 is approximately 0. 397. Neither of these operations come close to necessary to our target 89.
Considering the smaller numbers 29 and 73, let's test: we can obtain 29 * 3 = 87, and we need 89. If we reconfigure 29 + 3 = 32 and then 73 + 32 = 105 which is more than we need. Also, we can eliminate the need for 32 by finding the leftover after subtraction.
The number 73 is higher than 89, so let's think if we can get the difference. If we use 96 and subtract 73, we get:
96 - 73 = 23.
We're still far short of getting 89, and adding any numbers or operations might not yield the needed result. Let's reconsider using the other lower number 29 and 73 together in different ways:
(96 - 73) * 29 / 1000 is unlikely since 1000 is too large for an effective operation result.
96 - 73 - 29 does not reach the target either.
There's still 95 left, it seems we should find a way to use that and 29 or 73 in an operation. Multiplying or adding might work:
(95 - 73) * 29 = 22 * 29 = 638.
That's too large. But by adjusting, we can:
29 * 73 / 95 = 2123 / 95 = 22.468 which is around 22, and then:
96 - 22 = 74, 74 + 15 = 89.
But there's no way to get 22 from provided numbers.
Looking at the equation again, we need 22 and are short, and:
73 * 29 / 95 = 2227 / 95 = 23. 35 is closer but still leaving us short.
Considering 96 - 95 leaves 1.
Then, we need to reach 87 by some operations with 29 and 73.
Thus the original and added 1 from 96 - 95 can be adjusted:
73 + 29 + 1 = 103, which is not our target.
Therefore, the final closest combination from given number operations logic:
(96 - 73) * 29 / 1000 is not applicable, 29 * 73 is too large, 73 - 29 = 44 which is not enough, we're left with:
96 - 73 - 29 + 1 = 95 - 102 = -7.
But we need 89, so let's reiterate:
96 - 73 - 29 + 95 = 89.
Hence the final equation that equals 89 is: 96 - 73 - 29 + 95 = 89.</think>
<answer> 96 - 73 - 29 + 95 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the arithmetic operations we can use to approach 83. Since the numbers to operate on are 68, 95, and 80, a useful calculation could be the sum of 68 and 80, then adjusting that result to get to 83 with 95. Let's start with 68 + 80 = 148. We need to reduce it to 83 using 95. The logical way to do this operation given the numbers is subtraction, where 148 - 95 could yield the solution. However, with the current setup, we're 95 - 148 = -53, which is not correct.
Another approach could be to consider 95 as a multiplier and see if we can get closer to 83 by adjusting the first two numbers. Let's try 95 / 1 = 95. This is clearly not the approach we need either, as we need to reduce from 148 to 83. Taking this one step further, we realize that by manipulating 68 + 80, maybe we can use multiplication or division differently.
Given we need to get to exactly 83, let's try the breakdown as 95 + 68 - 80. This is because we know 95 and we need to adjust this to come closer to 83. Performing the operation, 95 + 68 - 80 = 83. </think>
<answer>95 + 68 - 80</answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 24, 73, and 20 that equals 69. We can start by calculating the differences and sums between these numbers, as well as looking at the multiplication and division operations. As we know, we can only use each number once.
1. First, let's see if we can subtract any of the numbers from 73 or add 20 to it to approach 69.
   - 73 - 24 = 49
   - 73 - 20 = 53
   - 73 - 20 + 20 = 73
   - Adding 20 to 73 doesn't help us reach the required number accurately. Subtraction seems promising since we can further reduce the difference to reach 69.
2. Let's try subtracting 20 from 73 first, and then checking if we can get to 69 by calculating with 24:
   - From above, we have 73 - 20 = 53.
   - We need 53 - ? = 69. But this subtraction is too large, so let's try the other possible combination.
   - Next, let's see if we can take 24 away from 73 in a way that helps get us to 69.
   - 73 - 24 = 49, and then 49 - 20 = 29, and 29 - 10 = 19 and we are still far away from 69.
   - Let's try to take 24 from 73 and then use 20 to adjust the result.
   - 20 can be subtracted from 24 to make it 73 - (24 - 20) = 20.
     This results in 73 - 24 + 20 = 69, which equals 69.</think>
<answer> 73 - 24 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 51, 59, and 83 where each number can only be used once, I'm going to try various combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the possibility of subtraction and addition since the numbers seem close to 75. I'll check if subtracting 59 from 83 will result in a number close to the one we need to add to 51 to reach 75.
83 - 59 = 24.
Now we need another number that can be obtained by adding 51 to 24, resulting in 75.
51 + 24 = 75.
So our numbers and operations are combined to give us 83 - 59 + 51 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 59) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider using addition and subtraction to try to get close to 58 with the given numbers. Taking a look at 69 and 16, their sum would be 85, which is 27 more than 58. 
Now, think about reducing this by using 5. We know 59 is just 16 short of 75 (which could be derived from 16 * 5) and 69 divided by 1 is 69. The difference between 59 and 69 is 10. Thus, we would need to remove 20 from our sum of 85 to get to 58, which can be accomplished by subtracting 16 from 69 and adding 5. Therefore, the equation would be: 69 - 16 + 5 </think>
<answer> 69 - 16 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how to make 50 using the numbers 2, 2, and 50. One way to approach this is to look for a combination that involves at least one of the zeros which could be derived from the number 50. We know that 50 / 2 = 25. Also, 50 + 2 = 52 but we need to reduce that to 50. Let's see if we can subtract 2 from this result. If we take 52 - 2 we get 50. So, I can form this equation using the numbers available.</think>
<answer> (50 + 2) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 53, 62, and 2 to create an equation that equals 22. The goal is to do this using basic arithmetic - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number must be used just once.
Let's start by thinking about the 2. It's a small number close to the target 22, so it might be useful in a subtraction or division.
Now I will consider the other two numbers: 53 and 62. Given that 22 is relatively small compared to these two numbers, it's possible that division or some combination of the other two numbers can significantly reduce the value. 
Let's test division. 62/2 = 31, which is closer to 22 than 53, but still isn't there. Now if we subtract 31 from 53 we have 22, which is the number we want. So, let's form the equation based on this.
</think>
<answer> (53 - 62 / 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add the numbers to see if I can get closer to 77. Starting with 70 and 48, I get:
70 + 48 = 118, which is too large. Next, I'll try combining the other two numbers 70 and 55:
70 + 55 = 125, still too large. Lastly, I'll try adding 48 and 55:
48 + 55 = 103, still quite a bit off. Now, I'll think about subtraction to reach the number. By subtracting the smallest number (48) from the largest (70):
70 - 48 = 22. This is still not enough, but it's closer. Now I'll try using the difference found (22) with 55:
77 - 55 = 22. This works! Therefore, we can use the equation:
77 = 55 + (70 - 48) </think>
<answer> 55 + (70 - 48) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 77, 86, and 89 to get 98. From the given numbers, 89 and 86 are close to 98. So I will consider adding 86 and 89 first, which gives me:
86 + 89 = 175
Now, 175 is much higher than 98, so I need to do a negative operation to get closer to 98. However, if I subtract 77 from 175, I get:
175 - 77 = 98
This way, all numbers are used once and the equation equals 98. </think>
<answer> 86 + 89 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> The numbers we have to work with are 34, 25, and 53. Our goal is to reach the number 44 using these numbers only once and any combination of arithmetic operations. 
Considering the size of the numbers, we might need to look for a subtraction or a division to reduce the value.
Let's try subtracting 34 and 25 first:
34 - 25 = 9
Now, we are left with 9 and 53. We can check how to utilize these to arrive at 44. Subtracting 53 from 9 won't help, and adding or multiplying won't give us 44 as the final result.
Now let's try to think of division. If we divide 53 by 13, we will get 4 with a remainder, but we cannot use 13. Let's try dividing by other numbers.
Dividing 53 by 25 yields 2 with a remainder of 8, which doesn't help us. Let's try dividing 53 by 34:
53 / 34 = 1.56 (not an integer, so this is not viable)

Given the options we have, let's try another approach:
We see that (53 - 25) = 28, which, given that we want to subtract this amount from 34 to get 44, we can rearrange the equation.
34 - 28 = 6.
Now, if we do 6 * 4, we get 24. That means:
53 - 34 = 19,
19 + 24 = 43, and if we do it a final time:
43 + 1 = 44
So we need another operation to get from 24 to 44.
24 + 20 = 44
We've already used 34, 25, and 53, and 20 cannot be made using just these numbers and operations, and shouldn't use a new number.
Thus, we now need to use the numbers in a combination that doesn't violate the rule that each number can be used only once. An alternative might be to use what we have left and add them up.
Considering:
53 - 34 = 19
19 + 25 = 44
This satisfies the conditions.</think>
<answer> 53 - 34 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I want to form an equation using the numbers 65, 20, 3 that results in 42. To achieve this, I will start by deducting smaller numbers from a larger number. The first step could be 65 - 20, which equals 45. Now I have to reduce by 3 to get to 42. I can do that by subtracting 3 from 45. (65 - 20) - 3 = 42. Now the equation using the numbers once is: 65 - 20 - 3 = 42. </think>
<answer> (65 - 20 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I see we have the numbers 36, 22, and 58 to work with and need to find an equation that equals 44 using basic arithmetic operations. 
- First, let's consider the numbers in relation to 44. We can try subtracting 22 from 36: 
  36 - 22 = 14
- Having 14, we can add 58 to get closer to 44:
  14 + 58 = 72
- Since 72 is too large, let's subtract 72 from 44:
  44 - 72 = -28 (Not what we want)
- As a next approach, negative numbers could also be considered. If we subtract 36 from 58:
  58 - 36 = 22
- But then, if we add 22 to 22, we don't match 44:
  22 + 22 = 44 (This works! )
- So, the equation combining these steps would be 58 - 36 + 22 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 36 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider multiplying and dividing, as these are more likely to reduce the range of numbers (26, 36, 43) into manageable targets. I'll begin by trying to use 26 or 36 as the result, as they're in the middle.
- Using 36: The numbers that can be combined to give 36 are 43 - 7, but 7 is not among the numbers. 36 = 26 + 10, but 10 is not among the numbers. 36 can be written as 43 - 7, but 7 is not in the list. 36 cannot be formed using the numbers given in only one way.
- Using 26: I can subtract 43 - 26 = 7. But again, 7 is not among the numbers.
- It seems calculating with the numbers given to get 36 is impossible. Now, I'll look for the options left: 43 and 36. 
- For getting 33, 43 - 10 = 33, and 10 is 36 - 26. This means we could use 43 - (36 - 26) = 33.
</think>
<answer> 43 - (36 - 26) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to structure the equation in a way that uses the numbers 38, 19, and 3 only once, to get the result of 54.
One approach is to see if we can combine numbers or their operations to get close to 54. 38 and 19 add up to 57, which is close to 54 but a bit too large. If we subtract 3 from 57, it becomes 54. The equation could look something like (38 + 19) - 3.
Let's test this:
1. Calculate 38 + 19, which equals 57.
2. Subtract 3 from 57, which equals 54.
Hence, the equation that satisfies the condition is: (38 + 19) - 3.
</think>
<answer>(38 + 19) - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 65 and 49 which are relatively large in value. They are close together and may need to be manipulated using addition or subtraction to get them closer to 14. Given that 49 is closer to 50, the first thought is to subtract 49 from 65, which simplifies the equation to 16 - 65.
However, 16 - 65 is not equal to 14. I'll consider adding the numbers 2 and 49 and then subtracting 65 to see if I can get closer to 14. Adding 2 and 49 gives us 51. Then subtracting 65, we get -14, so that doesn't work either.
Moving on, I'll consider if I can use the numbers by performing addition first. Adding 65 and 2 gives us 67. Unfortunately, there seems to be no easy operation to perform with this to reach 14 that involves only subtraction.
Finally, there's the option to multiply. If I multiply 2 and 49, I get 98. Adding 65 to 98 does not give me 14, so this isn't suitable either.
Given all these approaches, it seems like subtracting could help. If I subtract 49 from 65, I get 16. The only way to get to 14 from 16 using the last number (2) is to subtract 2 from 16. This gives me the equation: 65 - 49 - 2 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 49 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 95, 13, and 14 to work with, and we need to create an equation that equals 68. Initially, 95 seems too large to be used directly in subtraction or division without overshooting our target. However, we could subtract 13 or 14 from 95, and then use the result in a calculation that would bring us to 68 using the other numbers.
Let's try 95 - 13 first:
This gives us 82. Now we have 14 and we need to find a way to get 68 from these numbers.
Now, let's subtract 14 from 82:
This gives us 68. All the numbers have been used exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 13) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 59, 62, and 16 exactly once such that the final result is 13. Let's explore the different operations now.
First, division and multiplication could potentially be helpful as they would allow us to manipulate the numbers effectively. However, since we are looking for a single outcome of 13, I'll first think about division as it can reduce the magnitude of the numbers.
Let's try using division on 62 and 16. 
62 / 16 = 3.875
This result is not 13, but it's nearby. Now, I'll try subtracting the product of 59 and the result of the division from 13. 
59 * 3.875 = 229.625
Now, subtract this from 13:
13 - 229.625 = -216.625
This also doesn't yield the number 13. Going back to the numbers 59 and 62, if we sum their values:
59 + 62 = 121
Now, let's look at what happens if we use subtraction on these results:
121 - 13 = 108
This doesn't help either. 
What if we look at using 16 in a different way? If we subtract the divisor from the dividend (62 - 46) and then divide by 16, we get:
(62 - 16) / 16 = 46 / 16 = 2.875
Then let's subtract this from our sum of 121:
121 - 2.875 = 118.125
Still not our target. If we take 59 - 16, the result is:
59 - 16 = 43
Then if we divide our target result 13 by this final difference:
13 / (59 - 16) = 13 / 43 = 0.30234...
None of these steps have worked. To figure out the best route, I need to think about using 16 with another arithmetic operation.
16 itself could be used. If I multiply 16 by a number such that when subtracted from 59 that sum, divided by 62 minus a part of 16, we can arrive at 13. 
If I take 43 / 3 = 14.33, the closest integer solution, we would use 43/3 since 16 * 43/3 = 217.33, then:
(59 - 217.33) / 62 = -158.33/62 = -2.563...
However, this does not equal 13.
Playing with these operations more closely, I find:
16 * (59 - 43) / 62 = 16 * 16 / 62 = 256 / 62 ≈ 4.12 
This is not 13 either. 
In revisiting the possibility of division and manipulation:
59 / (62 - 16) = 59 / 46 = 1.28E2-1
I have gone in circles.
Let's assume I use 59 - 62 values:
(59 - 62) / 16 = -3 / 16 = -0.1875
I am close but not there.
(59 - 62 + 16) / 16 = 13 / 16 = 0.8125
Realizing this does not reach my target.
Finally, combining different numbers through steps:
16 + 59 - 62 = 13
This directly equals the number 13 using the combined arithmetic operation.</think>
<answer>(16 + 59 - 62)</answer>

==============
<think> The numbers provided are 92, 50, and 91. We need to generate an equation using these numbers exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that equals 51.
First, let's try combining 91 and 50 since they are close to 51. The difference between 91 and 50 is 41, which seems to be large to possibly reach 51 with 92. However, 91 - 41 = 50.
Next, let's subtract the difference from 92: 92 - 41 = 51.
So, the equation formed would be: 92 - (91 - 50) = 51.
</think>
<answer> 92 - (91 - 50) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 81, 71, and 62. I need to form an equation using each exactly once that equals 90. If I look at the target number, 90, it seems closer to lower numbers, so I might need to subtract or divide. Meanwhile, 81 is the largest number, so it might be good to subtract from it to get closer to 90.
Let's try with 81 - 71 = 10. While 10 is close to 90, we still need the other two numbers to make up 80. Now, I can take 62 and subtract it to reach 90: 81 - 71 - 62 + x = 90. But since we can't use the numbers more than once, we'll adjust this by manipulating our target operation. 
It seems removing 62 from 81 first and then finding another way with 71 and 62 isn't working well. Let's try to use multiplication or division within the steps.
81 * (71 / 62) is approximately 81 * 1. 141 (calculated in mind), which is closer to 90, but the answer is approximately 89, still not exact. However, if we use 81 * (71 / 62) - y = 90, and y = 81 * 1. 141 - 90 = 0. 141, the application of 0. 141 isn't an integer, so this isn't viable.
Lastly, let's try: 81 - 62 + 71 = 90, which satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 62 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we are working with - 65, 25, and 78. We need to create an expression that gives us 12.
- One approach could be to use the subtraction operation to adjust one of the values to get closer to 12.
- By considering 78 and 25 first, subtracting 25 from 78 gives us 53.
- Now, we need to use 65, and if we subtract 53 from 65 we will have 12.
- Thus, our equation will be: 65 - 53 = 12.
 </think>
<answer> 65 - (78 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 29, and 37. We need an equation that uses these numbers in such a way that the final result equals 77. Observing the numbers, we see that 69 and 29 can be manipulated to get closer to 77.
If we use 69 - 29 = 40, we want to then get 37 closer to the final result of 77. This suggests we could use 40 + 37 = 77. However, we must use the numbers 69, 29 and 37 each exactly once.
Now, let's see if we can build on 69 and 29 directly. One possibility is 69 - 29 = 40, and then find a way to add 37 to reach 77 using the remaining number. We could then add 37 to 40, which indeed gives us 77.
So, the equation using the numbers provided would be: 69 - 29 + 37 = 77.
</think>
<answer>69 - 29 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> I start with the given numbers [69, 29, 37]. I need to combine them using basic arithmetic to reach 77. The number 69 seems the most complex to work with, and 29 and 37 can be potentially combined in various ways to help reach 77.
Let's consider if we can combine 37 and 29 in some way. If we add them, we get: 37 + 29 = 66. Now, we need 11 more to reach 77. If we take 69 - 11, we get 58, which isn't close to what we need.
Instead, let's try multiplying 37 and 29: 37 * 29 = 1073, which is far from 77. That seems unlikely.
Multiplying 69 by either 29 or 37 alone is also not feasible. Given that 69 is significantly larger than 77 and 29 and 37 are not big enough to produce 77, the options to apply operations directly on 69 itself seems the most promising.
Let's re-evaluate with the operations:
If we consider 69 - 29 = 40, then adding 37 to it: 40 + 37 = 77. This gives us a result of 77 successfully! </think>
<answer> 69 - 29 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the number 93 using the numbers 92, 1, 14, 14. Given that 92 is very close to 93, I'll subtract 14 from 92 first. This will give me 78. Next, to get from 78 to 93, I need to add 15. I can form 15 using 14 and 1 by adding these numbers together. So, my equation becomes (92 - 14 + 14). 
Now I'll construct my final equation: (92 - 14) + 14 = 78, then I need to add 15 more to reach 93. So, the final equation to be constructed is (92 - 14) + 14 + 1 = 93. 
Therefore, the equation should be (92 - 14) + 14 + 1.
</think>
<answer>(92 - 14) + 14 + 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I will evaluate the options given the constraints. We have the numbers 3, 16, and 81. The target is 43. Let's first consider multiplication and division, as they can potentially bring us closer to 43 or reduce the disparity between the target and the sum/difference.

Considering division, using 16 or 81 could be useful. If we divide 16 by 4, we get 4, which is close to but not quite 39 (43 - 4 = 39).

Secondly, let's try combinations with the number 3. If we use 81 / 3, we get 27. Now, if we operate on 27 with the remaining number, 16, we can reach 43 with a simple equation: 27 + 16. This succeeds in reaching 43.
</think>
<answer> (81 / 3) + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations that could be useful in making the numbers 32, 70, and 34 combine to give 68. Since these numbers are large and 68 is close to 70, using addition or subtraction might be tricky, so I'll focus on multiplication and division.
Considering some basic divisions, we find that:
70 / 34 is approximately 2.06, which isn't helpful.
But 70 / 32 could be close to 2.19, which resembles 2.25. This seems promising.
So, let's calculate 70 / 32, we get approximately 2.19.
Now we have 2.19 and 34, and we need to get 68.
2.19 * 34 gives approximately 74, which is close to 68.
Therefore, we now need to reduce it by 6, and we can use the number 32.
32 - 6 = 26, but that's too little. 
Let me now try a new combination, adding 34 with 32 should give me 66.
Then, to get 68, I could subtract 2. But 2 is not one of the numbers I have.
A different approach, combining all three: 70 - 34 gives 36, then adding 32 to it gives 68.
So, 70 - 34 + 32 equals 68.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 34 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 16, 91, 49, and 43 exactly once. 
One strategy is to look at subtraction first because 91 - 43 will give us 48, which is close to 81. 
Now we need to achieve the difference of 19 between 91 - 43 = 48 and 81. We can try adding 49 to 48 to make 97 and then subtracting 16 to get 81.
So, the strategy is: (91 - 43 + 49) - 16 = 81. </think>
<answer>(91 - 43 + 49) - 16</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 32, 33, and 41 only once. 
I see that 41 is close to 40, so 41 - 1 will give me 40. 
However, I need a '1' and 41 is not a single number. 
Next, I notice that 41 + 32 = 73 and 73 - 33 = 40. 
So, I'm getting closer, but I need 33 to be -3 instead of +32.
If I invert the whole operation, then -33 + 73 = 40. 
Thus, the equation will be taking the negative of 33 from 41 + 32.
</think>
<answer> (41 + 32) - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 35, 50, and 56 once each and combine them to make 29. 
I'll start by considering subtractions. Subtracting 35 from 50 can give 15. This is close to 29, but we need 29, not 15.
Next, seeing if I can subtract the larger remaining number to get closer to 29 might be helpful. 
56 - 35 is 21. Now we have to find a way to get from 21 to 29 more easily.
Since 29 - 21 = 8, and 8 can be produced by 50 - 32 (which isn't directly possible with the given numbers), I'll check to see if 32 is achievable by combining the numbers. 
I notice that 56 - 35 = 21. Now 21 - 35 is not equal to 8, so I'll try another combination.
56 - 50 = 6. Adding 6 to 35 does not get me the 8 I need.
After testing, I see 56 - 35 = 21, and 50 - 21 = 29, but I can only use each number once.
I'll take 56 - 50 = 6, then I can use that 6 with 35 to make 41, which doesn't help, and I'm not close to 29.
Instead, I'll consider 50 - (35 - x) and need x to be 4. But 4 is not an option here.
I'll then test possibilities that work with the current known equations:
35 + 50 - 56 = 35 + (50 - 56) = 35 - 6 = 29.
So, 35 + 50 - 56 equals 29.
</think>
<answer>35 + 50 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target number - 99. Next, I'll examine the numbers: 36, 26, and 89. Clearly, 89 is the largest and 26 is the smallest. Subtracting 26 from 89 gives us 63, which is closer to 99 than we started with. Now, the difference between 99 and 63 is 36. Therefore, we can express 99 as 89 - 26 + 36. This satisfies the equality and each number is used exactly once. </think>
<answer> 89 - 26 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll list out a few basic operations to start with: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Given that division produces fractional results and multiplication mostly just scales numbers, let's try subtraction and addition. 
I see that 58 is the highest number and is relatively far from 64. This suggests a subtraction operation might be key. Maybe the difference from 58 to 64 could help. 
58 - 19 = 39
This gives us 39 which is close but still not 64. It's natural that we might look for a way to add to this result. 
Next, I notice that 12 + 13 = 25 which is below 64. I see that if I add 25 to 39, I can reach 64. 
So, the equation involves:
(58 - 19) + 12 + 13 = 64
</think>
<answer>(58 - 19) + 12 + 13</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination that can generate 94 using the numbers 76, 44, and 62 with basic arithmetic. I notice that 94 is close to 96, which is 2 more than 94. Since 44 is the smallest number, I might be able to subtract it from 76 to make the gap smaller. 
The equation would be: 76 - 44 + 62 which simplifies to 32 + 62. Now, 32 + 62 equals 94.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 44) + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by considering the target number: 25. The numbers I have are 49, 34, 19, and 59. 25 is close to 19, which suggests subtraction could be involved. Let's see if subtracting 19 from 34 gives us 15. Indeed, 34 - 19 = 15. Now I need 15 more to get to 25. 15 is exactly 59 - 49. Therefore, the equation that works for me is 34 - 19 + 59 - 49 = 25. </think>
<answer> (34 - 19) + 59 - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 79, 45, and 20. We need to create an equation that equals 14. 
We need to use each of these numbers exactly once, and the only allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Considering 20 is a large number, it's likely that we'll need to use division or some other operation to get it closer to 14.
We could try to get 14 using 45 and 20. For instance, we can think of 45 ÷ 20, which doesn't equal 14, but could give us a fraction that helps.
Let's see if we can arrange 79 in such a way that the equation equals 14. We should check if we can add, subtract, or multiply other numbers to reach 14.
If we take 45 and 20, their subtraction (45 - 20) gives us 25, which doesn't help. However, 45 - 20 = 25 and then 79 - 25 = 54, which, if divided by 3, equals 18. That's still too far from 14.
Now, considering 79, we don't have numbers of simpler subtraction that could help. So, maybe we should explore 79 with 45.
If we take 79 - 45 = 34, and then think of multiplying by 20 and using 14. Since we've already used 25 with 45-20, then considering 34, dividing it by 2 would give 17. And, if we divide 34 by 2, we get 17.
This seems way too large for 14. Then, let's consider that we could use division: 79 - 45 = 34, and then 34 / 2 = 17. This doesn't fit our goal, but it's the closest we have so far.
Considering that 25 - 7 = 18 with 45 - 20, we should check 79 and adjust accordingly. As we cannot include subtraction on fractions or decimals, we should look at 79 and see if we can form a smaller number. We could think of 79 - 45 + 20, which equals 54, and then further division. But 25 - 7 isn't possible using 20 alone to reach 14.
Let's reframe it using simple operations. Since 45 - 20 = 25, dividing 25 by 2 gets us 12.5, not 14. So we must have another approach.
We can think that, since 79 - 45 = 34, 34 - 20 = 14, and that uses all numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 45) - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers provided: 60, 15, and 47. 
Looking at these, we can observe that 60 - 15 = 45, which is close to 28 but a bit too high.
Next, I see that 60 - 47 = 13.
Considering 15 can only be used once, I can think of a formula involving 13 and 15.
If I add 13 and 15 I get 28.
Therefore, the equation can be 15 + (60 - 47) = 28.
</think>
<answer>15 + (60 - 47)</answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I need to evaluate the given numbers 32, 6, 63 to get 89. Adding 32 and 63 gives 95, which seems close to 89. Subtracting 6 from 95 gives 89, which is the target number. Now, the operation of adding 32 and 63 is straightforward. We just need to combine these into a single equation using the available numbers. I can write it as: 32 + 63 - 6. </think>
<answer>32 + 63 - 6</answer>

==============
<think> I need to achieve the result of 77 using the numbers 19, 92, 9, and 5 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Starting with the larger numbers, 92 seems promising. Subtracting 9 from 92 gives us 83. Now, 77 is closer to 83 rather than 9, so we make a slight adjustment by subtracting 6 instead of 9. So we subtract 5 from 92 to get 87, and then subtract 10 to get 77. The number 10 can be obtained by subtracting 19 from 9. This gives us the equation: 92 - 5 - (19 - 9).
</think>
<answer> 92 - 5 - (19 - 9) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers [20, 18, 75] up to one time each, let's consider the operations we have.
The target number is 73.
Starting with 75 would mean subtracting 2 (75 - 2 = 73).
However, our only other number is 20, which we need to work with to reach 73.
18 - 20 = -2, which is too negative.
Multiplying 75 with 18 or 20 won't give us the result of 73.
Now, let's try a combination with 20. If we add 20 to 18, we get 38. To reach 73 from 75, we need to further reduce 38 from 75.
75 - 38 = 37, but we need 73, so this isn't the answer.
Considering division operations, 75 / 18 or 75 / 20 won't get us 73.
Adding 75 and 20 doesn't help (75 + 20 = 95, not 73).
Finally, subtracting: 75 - 20 = 55. To get to 73 from 55, we need to reduce 55 by 22, which isn't an immediate possibility.
Considering the nature of the problem, it appears that the sought equation is a combination involving the subtraction of 20 from 75 and then adding something that equals 73 when added to 55.
75 - 20 = 55. To reach 73, we need to add 18 (because 55 + 18 = 73).
So the equation is: 75 - 20 + 18 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 20 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers given: 93, 85, and 76. We need to find a way to use each of these numbers only once to get a result of 84. 
Since we are working with a target of 84 and the numbers we have are relatively close to 84, a possible way is to start by adjusting the numbers by subtraction and possibly division.
If I look at 93 and 76, I realize 93 - 76 equals 17. This isn't immediately helpful towards our goal of reaching 84.
Moving on to the next possible operations, we can look at the subtraction between 85 and 76 which gives us 9.
Now, instead of using the original numbers directly, let's think if combining them in a different way might work. 
If I take 85 - 17, which is the result of 93 - 76, and then add 76, the equation becomes (85 - (93 - 76)) + 76. 
Let's evaluate this step-by-step:
(85 - 17) + 76 = 85 - 17 + 76 = 68 + 76 = 144.
Clearly, this doesn't give us 84. 
Since operations on 17 didn't work out and adding or subtracting 76 didn't help, let's explore what happens if we rearrange the order and operations. 
Considering 93 - 85 = 8, 8 + 76 = 84. 
Rearranging the numbers and using operations in this way does give us our target.
So, the correct equation is (93 - 85) + 76 = 84.
</think>
<answer>(93 - 85) + 76</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get to 94 using the numbers 36, 39, and 97. These numbers don't make it easy to reach 94 directly, so I should think of a combination of operations that could help.
Considering the numbers available, multiplication and division seem promising as they can potentially alter the value in a useful way.
I observe that 97 is the largest number, which might be operated upon to make the other two numbers significant.
I can take 97 and subtract 39, which leaves me with 58 (97 - 39 = 58).
Next, I need to get from 58 to 94. The difference between 94 and 58 is 36 (94 - 58 = 36).
So I realize that 36 can be achieved by adding 36 (36 + 0 = 36). However, 0 is not available, so I need to think of another way.
I take 58, subtract 39 (leaving me with 58 - 39 = 19). Then, I can add 36 to 19 (19 + 36 = 55) to get 94 (since 19 + 36 = 55 and 94 - 55 = 39 which equals 39).
So, combining all these steps together, I get:
97 - 39 + 36 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 39 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 48, 47, and 41, and equals 40. I can approach this by first looking for number combinations that can be subtracted or added to approach 40.
Considering the numbers, if I subtract smaller numbers from larger ones, I might reach a target around 40. Noting that 47 is quite close to 40, I can attempt 47 - some number, where the number subtracted is picked from the other two numbers, 48 and 41.
- If I subtract 41 from 47, I get 6.
- If I then subtract 6 from 48, I get 42.
- Unfortunately, 42 is too high.
Instead, I should think about combining two of the numbers and then subtracting another.
If I subtract 48 - 41 from 47, I get:
47 - (48 - 41)
That simplifies to:
47 - 7
And this equals:
40
Therefore, the equation that uses 48, 47, and 41 to get 40 is 47 - (48 - 41).
</think>
<answer>47 - (48 - 41)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 63, 58, 6, and 71. Given that 63 and 71 are quite far from 44, let's try to use their differences or other numbers in a way that can be manipulated to reach 44.
Considering 71 and 63 differ by 9, and 58 is close to 44, I'll try to use these numbers to lean towards 44.
71 - 58 = 13
Now I need to reach 31 from 6. I can use division: 6 / 2 = 3, but to reach 31, I need a larger multiple. Using 6 / 6 gives me just 1, so this doesn't work.
Next, I recall the difference of 9 from 71, can be divided by 3 to reach 31: (71 - 58) / 3 = 3, which brings me closer but not quite there.
Using 63 - 71 + 58 - 6, I get:
63 - 71 = -8,
-8 + 58 = 50,
50 - 6 = 44.
Therefore, the equation that equals 44 with the given numbers is:
(63 - 71 + 58 - 6) = 44.
</think>
<answer>(63 - 71 + 58 - 6)</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 17, 80, and 38 that equals 59, I'll first try to manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
Starting with basic additions and subtractions:
17 + 80 = 97, which is far from 59.
Now, let's try operations involving subtracting 38:
97 - 38 = 59 is our target number, but we haven't used any of the numbers 17 or 80 yet.
Since 97 can be made from 80 + 17, I'll try combining these:
80 + 17 - 38 = 59
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and performs the operations to get the result of 59.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 17 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 97 using the numbers 39, 17, and 41. 
I'll start with calculating some possibilities:
- Adding 39 and 41 gives 80.
- If I add 17 to 80, I get 97 exactly. So, the equation becomes:
39 + 41 + 17 = 97.
Now I have used all the numbers only once and the equation holds true.
</think>
<answer>39 + 41 + 17</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if the numbers could be combined in a straightforward way to reach 78. The number 78 is not a sum of the given numbers, and 78 is not directly obtainable from 53 or 25 through multiplication or division. However, we can use the number 50 in the equation.
Next, I need to figure out what to do with the numbers 53 and 25. Observing that 53 - 25 = 28, which is close to 78 but not quite there. If we add 50, we get 28 + 50 = 78, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is (53 - 25) + 50 = 78.
</think>
<answer>(53 - 25) + 50</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers: 14, 65, and 43. We need to create an equation that results in 36, using each number only once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can consider using subtraction and division:
65 - 43 = 22
Now we need 14 to be used along with 22 to reach 36.
14 + 22 = 36
This satisfies all the conditions - we used each number, only basic arithmetic operations, and got the result we needed.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 43) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 61, 96, and 55 once each to get a total of 90. The most feasible approach would be to combine the numbers in a way they can be subtracted, added, or divided to reach 90.
Firstly, 96 - 61 = 35. This gives me 35 from the numbers provided.
Now, I have 35 and 55 left. Subtracting 55 from 35 will not get me closer to 90, so I need to think of another combination.
35 + 55 = 90. This gives me the target result, but I haven't used the subtraction of 61 and 96 in the process. 
Given that 61 - 55 = 6, I can approach the final combining: 90 - 6 = 84 is not valid since I need to keep 61 and 55 intact.
Instead, I realize I can combine the number by using 96 - (61 - 55) = 96 - 6 = 90. This gives me the 90 target with the use of all provided numbers once.
</think>
<answer> 96 - (61 - 55) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 96, 18, and 52 exactly once to produce the number 62. I should consider combining these numbers using arithmetic operations.
First, I notice that 96 - 52 = 44. This is a significant step.
Now I need to find a way to get from 44 to 62. Adding 18 to 44 won't work because that's 62, but we can't repeat numbers. Using subtraction or multiplication won't help either because 44 - 18 = 26 and 44 * 18 = 798, neither of which equal 62.
Then I realize that I need to subtract smaller numbers from 44 to reach 62. 44 - 18 = 26, if I subtract another 16, I would reach 62.
So I take 52 - 18 = 34, and then 96 - 34 = 62.
Thus, the equation is 96 - (52 - 18) = 62. </think>
<answer> 96 - (52 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations we can perform with the given numbers: 88, 65, and 89. We need to create an equation that results in 66. 
Looking at the numbers, it appears that a combination of subtraction or addition might be needed since the result 66 is close to one of the numbers and not extremely far.
- If we use subtraction, we could get close to 65-9 = 56 and then maybe 56+10 = 66.
- However, 9 is not one of the numbers.
- If we use addition, we could try to add and subtract numbers in a way that leads to 66.
- Let's try (89 + 65 - 88). 
  First, 89 + 65 = 154,
  Then, 154 - 88 = 66.
This satisfies the requirement using all numbers only once.
</think>
<answer>(89 + 65 - 88)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 83, and 20 that equals 94. 
- First, considering 83 is relatively large and 20 is relatively small, using multiplication or division would likely lead to a result outside the range of 94 with these numbers.
- Adding 20 to 83 gives us 103, which is too much, so that won't work.
- Subtracting 20 or 83 from 94 is not achievable with just these numbers.
- Using 9, we can see if combining it in various arithmetic operations can help.
- I notice that 94 - 20 = 74. So, if we could get 74 from 83 and 9, that would work.
- Now, 83 - 9 equals 74, and we already have 20.
- Therefore, the equation using 83 - 9 + 20 = 94.
</think>
<answer>(83 - 9) + 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the options and the target number. The target is 87, and the numbers we have are 85, 63, and 65. 
87 - 85 = 2, and 2 isn't enough to get us there using the other numbers.
63 - 65 = -2, which is not helpful either.
Let's consider other operations with the numbers.
65 - 63 = 2, which, if multiplied by something, might help, but no single number seems to fit.
65 + 63 = 128, which is too large.
Now, let's try 85 and 63:
85 + 63 = 148.
This is also not right.
But let's try another approach. Let's think about combining 85 and 63 in a different way.
85 - 63 = 22. If we then subtract 22 from 87 (our target), we get:
87 - 22 = 65.
So, we need to form 22 from 85 and 63. 
85 - 63 = 22.
Then we subtract this from 87:
87 - 22 = 65.
However, 65 isn't the correct target number. We need 87.
What if we reverse the order?
63 - 65 = -2, and multiply it by 43 (since 85 - 43 = 42 and 43 is needed to get 22).
(85 - 65) * 43 = 20 * 43 = 860, which is too large.
85 - 63 = 12. This is too large. 
Another approach would be:
87 - 65 - 63 = -41, which is not helpful.
I'll try adding smaller numbers:
(85 - 65) + 63 = 22
Then 87 - 22 = 65, which is incorrect.
Finally, we could try this:
85 - (63 - 65) = 85 - -2 = 87.
So, the equation is formed as:
85 - (63 - 65) = 87.
</think>
<answer> 85 - (63 - 65) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and how I can manipulate them to reach 87. The numbers are 85, 63, and 65. 
87 is close to both 85 and 65, which are both integers as well.
Given that we can use each number only once, I should start by considering if borrowing or adding 2 to 63 can help. 
By adding 2 to 63, we get 65, which is already one of our numbers. 
Now we're looking at 85 and 65 to solve for 87.
To get 87 from 85, I need to add 2. Since 65 is already present, I need to find out how to get 2 from 85 and 63.
85 - 63 = 22, which is far from our requirement, so it doesn't work that way.
I then consider a combination of multiplying 63 by a fraction that makes sense. If I take 1/3 of 63, I get 21, which could be subtracted from 85 to get 64, but we still need to reach 87.
Another approach could be combining 63 and 65. Their sum (128) is too large.
Looking at 85 - 65 = 20, which is close, but we still need 7 left to get to 87. 
If I use a negative operation, I can subtract 63 from 65 to get 2, and then add 85 to that: 
65 - 63 = 2
85 + 2 = 87
This way, I use all the numbers exactly once, and the equation checks out.
</think>
<answer> 85 + (65 - 63) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 37, 34, and 25 to equal 75. First, I'll consider using multiplication and addition/subtraction because these operations can combine the numbers effectively to reach 75. Looking at the numbers, multiplying 25 by 3 seems promising because that would give me 75, and 3 needs to be expressed using the other numbers.
If we take 34 - 21 = 13, then 13 + 25 = 38, and this doesn't help in getting 75 directly. However, now we have 13, and if we use 37 - 13, we get 24. Now, let's see if 24 + 38 equals 72, which is close but not quite there. The slight difference can be made up by using 13 directly.
From 34 - 21 = 13, if I combine this with 37, I would get 50. This still isn’t 75, but if I add 25 to 50, I get 75, which is our target.
So, the equation works out to be (34 - 21) + 37 + 25 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (34 - 21) + 37 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to think of a combination that can give me a result of 71 using the numbers 73, 48, and 46. Let's start by looking at what we can subtract from 73 to get close to 71. Subtracting 46 from 73 gives me 27, which is not 71. Now, let's consider dividing 73 by something. If I divide 73 by 48, I get approximately 1. 52, which isn't helpful.
Let's consider multiplying and dividing. Multiplying 48 and 46 gives 2208, which is far from 71. Dividing 73 by 46 gives approximately 1. 59, which seems close to a fractional answer.
Now let's try combining all these ideas. If I take 73, subtract 46, and then add 48, I am looking for the following equation: 73 - 46 + 48. Let's calculate it:
73 - 46 + 48 = 27 + 48 = 75,
This is slightly more than 71.
Let's try subtracting 48 from 73 instead and then adding 46: 73 - 48 + 46. Let's calculate it:
73 - 48 + 46 = 25 + 46 = 71.
We have found our solution.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 48 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 49, 82, and 19 to reach the number 52. Let's start by considering the numbers. We have four options for operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
One of the numbers might be the result of one of these operations on the other two numbers. Let's try the division first, as it could potentially bring us closer to the target:
49 / 19 = 2.5736 (approx).
This result is close but not 52. Next, if we consider 82 / 19, we get:
82 / 19 = 4.3158 (approx).
Again, this isn't close to 52. Let's try combining operations, using addition and subtraction:
(82 - 49) + 19.
Here we have 82 - 49 = 33, and then adding 19 gives us:
33 + 19 = 52. 
This results exactly in 52, which is our target.
</think>
<answer>(82 - 49) + 19</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the value of 82 using the numbers 6, 5, and 81. Given that 81 is close to 82, it seems likely that subtraction or addition of 1 will help. However, 6 is too small to be the difference between 6 and 82, and we can't use it again. Hence, we could try subtracting 5 from 81 and then adding 6. Let's calculate that: 81 - 5 + 6 = 81 - 5 = 76, and then 76 + 6 = 82. This works out. 
</think>
<answer> (81 - 5) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, note that 87 is quite close to 89, which is 2 more than our target number 87. This suggests we may need to add 2 to our equation to get 87. Looking at our numbers, 26 and 2 are numbers that could help achieve this. We need to add 2: 26 + 2 = 28. Now our equation is 28 + ? = 87 or, 28 + ? = 87 which needs an addition of 59 to be 87.
Considering that we can only use each number once, let's try to link 26 and 2 with 59 in some operation. To get 26 from 59 and 2, we can subtract 59 - 26 = 33, but this doesn't give us a way to include 2 again. However, 59 and 2 can be used with multiplication or division.
If we divide 59 by 2, we get 29.5, which is not an integer and we need an integer result and it's also not equal to 87.
Next, we look at subtraction: 59 - (26 - 2). If we perform this, we get 59 - 24 = 35.
Therefore, we can form the following equation: 26 + 2 + (59 - 26) = 87.
Let's simplify it: 26 + 2 + 33 = 87.
Since 26 + 2 = 28 and 28 + 59 - 26 = 87, it doesn't work. This means the only viable way to use 59, 26, and 2 to get to 87 involves multiplication and subtraction.
So, 59 * 1. 5 - 26 + 2 = 87. But we don't have 1. 5. Instead, let's think of combining operations to fit 2 numbers.
The final form we are looking for seems to involve these numbers: 59 - 26 + 2 * some number. We need to find the correct value for the multiplication to result in 87. 
2 * 35 = 70, closer but not quite there. We need a number close to 13.5. So, 2 * 35 and 59 - 26 = 33. 33 + 70 = 103. This is still not working.
We realize the structure we need is using the numbers 59, 26, 2 in a way that they can add up to 87 through operations. Let's try addition in reverse or subtraction first and multiplication:
59 + 26 + 2 * 1 = 87. But 2 * 1 results in 2, not 59. Thus the structure we are looking for is:
59, 26 + 2. Let's utilize the fact that 59 + 26 = 85, so adding 2 to get 87.
So, the equation is (59 + 26) + 2 = 87. Simplified this leads to 87 = 87.
</think>
<answer>(59 + 26) + 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 57, 36, and 91 that equals 70, using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with 57 and 36, I notice that 57 - 36 = 21.
Adding or subtracting 91 from these doesn't seem to get me closer to 70. 
Then, I see that if I use division, it might work. 
91 / 3. 67 ≈ 25 (not close to 70); it seems too difficult to get a nice integer solution this way.
Lastly, trying subtraction first with 91 - 57 and then adding 36:
91 - 57 = 34
34 + 36 = 70
Here I successfully used each number once and utilized subtraction and addition to reach 70.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 57 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if there's a combination that can yield 91 using the given numbers 17, 9, and 99. Subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones or adding in a way to approach 91 seems likely.
Let's try: 99 - 17 + 9
99 - 17 = 82
Now add 9 to 82: 82 + 9 = 91
So the equation is 99 - 17 + 9 = 91.</think>
<answer>99 - 17 + 9</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers available: 4, 38, and 78. I need to create an equation that equals 36 using basic arithmetic operations while ensuring each number is used only once.
One possible way to explore this is to use subtraction and division. Let's see if I can find a way to utilize 78 and 38 to reduce the number enough to reach 36 when combined with 4.
If I take 78 - 40 and then combine it with 38, I get 38 - 40 + 78, which simplifies to -2 + 78 = 76. This is too high. 
Instead, I'll try subtracting 38 from 78 and then finding how 4 can be incorporated. If I do 78 - 38 = 40, and then subtract 40 - 4 = 36.
So, the equation is: 78 - 38 - 4 = 36.
</think>
<answer>78 - 38 - 4</answer>

==============
<think> To get 36 with the numbers 4, 38, and 78, we need to think creatively about the operations we can use.
First, let's consider the numbers. 78 is the largest, and 38 is significantly larger than 4. This suggests we might look to manipulate these numbers using operations to create the target number 36.
Given 78 and 38, the difference between them is 40. If we can make use of 40 by subtracting 4, we can potentially move closer to 36.
So, let's see where we might have 4 or 38 left for subtraction. The number 38 itself might be ideal for subtraction from 40. If we subtract 4 from 38, we get 34. Now we have:
78 - 38 - 4 = 36
This equation uses 4, 38, and 78 only once each and correctly evaluates to 36. </think>
<answer> 78 - 38 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the given numbers 96, 38, and 40. I need to figure out how to use these numbers once each to create an equation that evaluates to 18. 
I notice that 96 - 38 = 58, which is a useful intermediate value.
Then, 58 - 40 = 18. This gives us the final value we need.
Thus, the equation is 96 - 38 - 40 = 18.
</think>
<answer> (96 - 38) - 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 92, 52, and 39. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once that equals 79.
- The subtraction route seems promising since it can yield a large difference or a smaller number.
- 92 - 52 = 40, which is close to 79, giving us a difference of 39.
- We also have the number 39, which is exactly what's needed to complete the equation.
Thus, the equation would be 92 - 52 + 39 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 52) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the options to get to 48 using the numbers 89, 11, and 52. We can start by subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones to see if we can get closer to 48.
If we subtract 52 from 89, we get: 89 - 52 = 37.
Now we need 11 more to reach 48. However, 11 was not subtracted in the previous step, so it's not enough to get us there.
Let's see if we can get 11 by using division or addition with the 11 and 52. Dividing 52 by 4 does give us 13, but that doesn't work because 37 + 13 = 50, and we're still short of 48.
Now, let's add 11 to 37: 37 + 11 = 48.
So, the equation that uses the numbers 89, 11, 52 and results in 48 is 89 - 52 + 11.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 52 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 56, 31, and 5 that equals 30. I'll start by considering what kind of operations could make this happen. Let's explore multiplying and adding or subtracting.
The number 56 is significantly larger, and dividing it by any of the other numbers won't get us close to 30. On the other hand, 31 is not far off from 30, and multiplying or adding/subtracting 5 will be more likely to get us to 30.
Let's look at: 31 - 5 = 26. This is close to 30, and now we need 4 more to reach 30. We don't have another big enough number to make 4. Let's try 56 - 31 = 25, and then see if we can get 5 from that. 
If we have 56 - 31 = 25, and we're still missing 5, we could try 25 + 5 = 30. This works out perfectly. So combining all these parts, we get:
(56 - 31) + 5 </think>
<answer>(56 - 31) + 5</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 75 using the given numbers 53, 15, and 37. One approach is to use the largest number, 53, as the base and try to reach 22. Since 15 + 37 = 52 and 53 - 15 = 38, we can use subtraction. Then, to get from 38 to 22, we can subtract 16. Looking back at the numbers, we see 53 - 37 = 16. Therefore, the equation should be 53 - (37 - 15) which equals 53 - 22 = 31. This is not quite 75, so I should reconsider. Another way to approach it could be to use multiplication and addition. Since 15 * 5 = 75, and 53 - 15 is 38, it feels like the best path to build up to 75. In that case, 53 - 15 = 38, and I need an additional 37 to reach 75, which can be achieved by adding 37 to this 38. Therefore, the final equation should be 53 - 15 + 37.
</think>
<answer>53 - 15 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll analyze the given numbers: 3, 50, 16, 94. 
- 50 and 94 don't seem likely to combine effectively to reach 31.
- Multiplying 3 by any of them will not give us 31, and dividing any of them by 3 won't yield an integer.
- Adding and subtracting can be tried by pairing 3 and 94, as 94 - 3 = 91 and 91 - 50 = 41.
- Then, if we add 16, we have 41 + 16 = 57, which is too large.
- But if we take 50 and 16, we could see if these two can be manipulated further.
- We can observe that 50 - 16 = 34. Now if we take 34 - 94, we would get -60, which doesn't help.
- But considering 34 - 50 = -6, again not helpful.
- Next, consider 50 - 34 (which is 16). This is essentially the same as before and points us to previous manipulations.
- Finally, combining 16 with 3 in a different way, let's calculate 94 - (50 - 16). 
  - 94 - 34 = 94 - (50 - 16) = 94 - 50 + 16 = 44 + 16 = 60, which exceeds 31.
- Let's simplify further by trying again with 94 - 50 + 16 = 50 - 50 + 94 = 44 + 16 = 60.
- We need to reach 31, and the current manipulations aren't working.
- We can consider the simpler pairing: 94 - (50 - 16) = 94 - 34 = 60.
- Instead, we should focus on: 94 - 50 + 16 - 3 = 94 - 50 + (16 - 3) = 44 + 13 = 57.
- We haven't reached 31 yet.
- Instead, we should try: 94 - 50 + (3 - 16) = 94 - 50 + (-13) = 44 - 13 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 50 + (3 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add and subtract the numbers in various combinations to see if we can get close to 71. One useful approach is to look for a way to use the higher numbers first to maximize the result.
Considering the numbers 43, 1, and 29:
- If we add 43 and 29, we get 72, which is very close to 71.
- However, we can't add 1 to 72 to get 71.
- Now, let's see if we can subtract 1 from 72 to get 71. This works out well since subtracting 1 from 72 equals 71.

So, the equation is 43 + 29 - 1 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 29 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 18, and 2 that equals 41. Let's consider the nature of the numbers. 57 is significantly larger than 41, so subtraction or direct division by 57 is not a viable approach. The number 18 is useful as it can be subtracted or multiplied, and 2 could be helpful as well. Let's try subtracting some of these numbers from 57.
57 - 18 = 39. This is closer but still not 41. Now, subtracting 2 from 39 is 37, which is not the target. Adding 2 to 39 is 41, which is exactly what we need. Thus, 
(57 - 18) + 2 = 41.
</think>
<answer>(57 - 18) + 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 57, 18, and 2 that when operated on will give me 41. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 57 is quite large and could possibly be manipulated through subtraction. 18 and 2 could be useful in achieving the target number 41.
1. Let's consider 57 - 18 which equals 39. We are close, but not quite there.
2. Next, I think of adding 2 to 39 to reach 41. So, 57 - 18 + 2 = 41.
3. All of the numbers 57, 18, and 2 are used exactly once and the equation equals 41. </think>
<answer> (57 - 18) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 68, 28, 43, and 41 that equals 38. 
First, considering the numbers given, 68 is quite larger and 41 is significantly smaller than 38, so these numbers are unlikely to be directly used in the arithmetic without going into complex operations.
28 and 43 are closer to 38, and they suggest subtraction could be useful, as in 28 - 43 = -15. This result is too far from 38. 
I see 41 is close to 38, and 68 is the only remaining number. If I subtract 41 from 68, I get 27.
Now, to reach from 27 to 38, I need to adjust it slightly. Luckily, 27 + 11 = 38. Now I need to find 11 using the numbers 28 and 43.
Considering 28 - 43 = -15, we went wrong with that approach. I need to find a way to rearrange. 28 - 43 is negative, so using 68 will reverse the sign, aiming for 43 - 28 = 15, which is close to 11.
Therefore, (68 - 43) - (28 - 41) = 25 - 11 = 14, which got me a bit off. However, I look for 11 further in my options. 
If I directly subtract 28 from 43, I get 15, which is almost right. Then I need to adjust this to get to 11. Adjusting by subtracting 4 from 15 results in 11. Therefore, I have 43 - 28 - (43 - 28) = 15 - 4 = 11.
Combining now, we get (68 - (43 - 28)) = 68 - (15) = 53 which is too large, so I need to check the initial assumptions. 
Revisiting, the correct steps are: ((68 - 43) - (28 - 41)) = 25 - 4 = 21, which is still off.
Correcting again logically, I get: (43 - (28 - (68 - 41)) = 43 - (28 - 27) = 43 - 1 = 42 which is too big.
Finally, I get it:  (68 - 28) - (43 - 41) = 40 - 2 = 38.
</think>
<answer>(68 - 28) - (43 - 41)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's break down the numbers we have: 64, 48, and 14. We need to use these in a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 30.
We can check possible combinations:
- If we try 64 - 48 = 16, we need a further operation to reach 30. 16 + 14 also doesn't work.
- If we consider multiplying and dividing, 64 / 14 doesn't yield a reasonable result.
- Let's try 64 - 48 = 16, and then apply the remaining 14. Do we have an operation to get 14? We could use 14 - 14, but that makes the result 0.
- Then, we can try this: 64 - (48 / 14). This would be 64 - 3.42857... which is not close to 30.
- We should also consider if we can subtract 64 from 48 and then do something with the result. For example: 48 - 64 * (14 / 10) = -15.6, which is far from our target.
- Considering 64 / 14 is not an exact answer and 48 / 14 isn't simple, let's think of another possibility: 64 / (14 - 48) or rearranged, (64 / (48 - 14))
- Checking the arithmetic: First, 48 - 14 equals 34, so we have: 64 / 34 = 1.882352941...
- Realizing this is still not close to 30, let's re-evaluate combining all possibilities. Perhaps, we can isolate 48 / 14 to get a whole number first, then possibly adjust.
- 48 / 14 = 3.42857... and 64 - 3 = 61, which is too high.
- Trying 64 / (48 - 14) = 64 / 34 = 1.882352941... This is not correct, the closest possible whole number result doesn't work.
- Given our constraints, it seems we need to find a combination where all numbers work together. Correcting the combination, we can work with: ((64 / 14) + 48) / 48.
- This evaluates to: 64 / 14 = 4.571428571, then adding 48: 4.5714 + 48 = 52.5714, and dividing by 48: 52.5714 / 48 = 1.096. This is still not right.
- The 64 - (48 / 14) = 57.1429 / 48 = 1.197 is close to our expected answer.
- Finally, by trying 64 - (48 / 14) / 14 is not yielding the correct answer, instead, we need to correctly calculate 64 / 14 - (48 - 14), which calculates: 64 / 14 = 4.571428571, then subtract 34 (48 - 14), 4.571428571 - 34 = -32.42857143, which still does not work.
- We recheck the logic of utilizing 64 - 48 and manipulations, noticing 64 - 34 = 30, hence using a simpler calculation: 64 - 48 + 14 = 30.

<think> To create an equation equaling 100 using the numbers 90, 78, and 68 exactly once, we need to consider combining them using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Initially, let's see if any of these numbers can be directly used in a simple operation.
The biggest number is 90, and subtracting 68 from 90 gives us 22, which is quite close to what we need. Now, if we add 78 to that result:
90 - 68 = 22
22 + 78 = 100
So, it looks like we can create the equation using these values in the exact way they appear.</think>
<answer> 90 - 68 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the possible combinations using the given numbers: 32, 57, and 60. We need to reach the target number 85.
- 60 + 57 = 117 (this is too high)
- 60 + 32 = 92 (this is also too high)
- 57 + 32 = 89 (this is close to 85, but still a bit high)
- 57 - 32 = 25 (we can use this to work towards our goal)
If we use 57 - 32 = 25, then we need to get from 25 to 85. We can achieve this by adding 60.
So, the equation becomes: 57 - 32 + 60 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (57 - 32) + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 67, and 65 that equals 11. Let's start by considering combinations of these numbers with the basic arithmetic operations. One way to get to 11 from these numbers might be using subtraction or division.
- Trying combinations, 65 - 67 does not work.
- 65 - 9 = 56, 67 - 9 = 58, and neither equals 11.
- Now trying 67 - 65, we get 2, and 65 - 2 = 63, still not 11.
- Let's try multiplication: 9 * 67 = 603, 65 * 67 = 4355, and obviously multiplication by 9 or 65 doesn't get us to 11.
- Now, let's try division: 65 / 67, 9 / 65 don't work.
- Considering the numbers 9 and 67, I could try 9 + 67 - 65. 
- If 9 + 67 = 76 and 76 - 65 = 11, this works!
So, the equation 9 + 67 - 65 equals 11. </think>
<answer> (9 + 67) - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 73 using the numbers 83, 36, and 26. One approach is to consider the subtraction as it could help in reaching the target number.
If I subtract 26 from 83, I get 57. Now I need to get from 57 to 73 by adding a number from the remaining list (36). 
57 + 36 = 93, which is not 73. But if I use division, 57 / 36 = 1.5833..., which isn't an integer number.
However, I can try another combination: 57 - 26 = 31. Now I need to reach 73 from 31. 
I can get 31 by subtracting 36 from 67. Since 67 isn't directly available, I might have to reconsider my additions and subtractions.
Considering the target 73, if I add 31 to another number from the list, I should check 36 + 37. But since 37 isn't available, I could use 36 - 3 = 33. This gets us 31 + 33 = 64, which still isn't our target.
For a more direct approach, since reversing operations often help, I think about multiplying or dividing in a way that might work with our numbers.
Observing the target of 73, let's try 83 - 36 = 47. If we add 26 to this 47, I get 47 + 26 = 73. This works!
So, the valid equation would be 83 - 36 + 26 = 73. </think>
<answer> 83 - 36 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that utilizes the numbers 29, 22, and 3 to equal 95. 
Starting by looking at 29, I can immediately see that 29 is the largest number. If we subtract 22 from 29, we get 7.
29 - 22 = 7
Now, to get closer to 95, I can multiply 7 by 3:
7 * 3 = 21
This gives me 21, and I need to get to 95. 
To get from 21 to 95, I need to add 74, but I only have 22 and 3 left. I need to find a way to use these numbers to get to 74.
Adding 22 and 3 gives me 25, which is not 74. 
Instead, let's consider if I can use multiplication between the remaining numbers. 
Multiplying 22 by 3 gives me 66, and then I can add 29 to get to 95.
95 = 29 + (22 * 3)
</think>
<answer>29 + (22 * 3)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers [24, 13, 46] to make 83. Let's try to isolate the largest number first, which is 46. 
If I use 46 as it is, I'll need to find a way to make up the difference (83 - 46 = 37) using the remaining numbers 24 and 13.
Now, 37 can be made by adding 24 and 13 (since 24 + 13 = 37).
So the equation I'm creating is: 46 + 24 + 13 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 24 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that equals 74 using the numbers 89, 44, and 29. Let's start by looking at the target sum and the numbers we have. 74 is quite close to 89, so we might consider subtraction or addition. Since 89 - 74 = 15 (which is not in the list), subtraction isn't feasible. Let's try addition: 89 + 44 = 133, which is too large. Now let's try to reduce 89 - 44 = 45. That's still not 74. Let's think of division or combining numbers in other ways. If I take 89 - 44, the result is 45, and if I then use the number 29 in some way, we might get close to 74. 45 - 29 = 16, which is still not 74. Now if we add 29 back to 16, we get 45 + 29 = 74. So, the equation that works is 89 - 44 + 29 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 44 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination using the numbers 64, 76, 93, and 60 to make 21. I notice 93 is quite large and 64 is relatively small. There's a good chance I might need to use subtraction. Let's try 93 - 64 and see if that leaves us with a number close to 21. 93 - 64 = 29. Now, I need to get to 21 with the remaining numbers 76 and 60. If I subtract 60 from 76, I get 16. Now, 29 - 16 gives me 13, which is not the solution. But let's try another combination: subtract 76 from 93. This gets me 17. Now I need to get to 21 with 60 and 64. To get from 17 to 21, I subtract 4. Given the numbers we have, 64 - 60 = 4. Therefore, the solution is 93 - 76 + 64 - 60 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 76 + 64 - 60 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 44, 2, and 6 to get 36. First, let's consider the use of multiplication or division for potentially getting a larger number. Using 44 and 6 together gives us 264, which is far too large. Using 264 and division with another number will produce a number much smaller than 36. So let's consider combining all numbers. 
Now, I notice that the operation of subtraction can bring us close to our target number. If we start by subtracting 6 from 44, we get 38. This leaves us with 2, which if subtracted from 38, results in 36. Thus, the equation becomes 44 - 6 - 2 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 44 - 6 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 10, 4, and 39 that equals 45. First, let's see how these numbers relate to 45. Adding larger numbers like 10 and 39 gives 49, which is closer to the target but a bit too high. Subtracting might bring us closer. Let's subtract 4 from 39 first and then add 10: 39 - 4 = 35. Now we have 35 and 10. To reach 45 from 35, adding 10 will work. Thus, the equation should be: 39 - 4 + 10 = 45.
</think>
<answer>39 - 4 + 10</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and the target result. We have 27, 47, and 11, and we need to form an equation that equals 85.
Looking at the numbers, we notice that 47 is quite close to 85, so it might be a good candidate for being used as is or transformed. If we add 11 to 47, we get 58, which is still far from 85. So, adding another number might help bridge this gap.
Now, considering 27, it doesn't seem to fit directly into some simple operation to reach our target. However, it could potentially be involved in taking away from our sum to reach 85.
47 + 11 equals 58, and if we add 27 to 58, we get 85. So the equation could be 47 + 11 + 27 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 47 + 11 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 27, 47, and 11 to make 85. 
First, let's try to use 47 as it is a large number and adding/subtracting/ dividing by it might bring us closer to 85.
Let's consider adding 27 to 47, which equals 74. 
Then, we need 11 more to reach 85. 
So, 47 + 27 = 74, and we need 11 more which is 85. This gives us the equation: (47 + 27) + 11.
Now let's verify the calculation: 47 + 27 equals 74, and 74 + 11 equals 85.
</think>
<answer>(47 + 27) + 11</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 59, 54, and 69 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to reach 74. 
First, I'll consider adding and subtracting these numbers. 
69 + 54 = 123
123 - 59 = 64
This brings me closer, but not quite there. 
Now, consider multiplying and dividing:
69 * 54 = 3726 (too big)
69 / 59 = 1.1633 (not an integer, and doesn't seem helpful here)
54 * 59 = 3186 (too large)
54 / 69 = 0.7824 (not an integer, and doesn't seem helpful here)
So, adding and subtracting seems more promising. Let's think about removing one of the bigger numbers to get closer to 74.
74 - 54 = 20, or 74 - 69 = 5
Since 74 - 54 = 20, we can use 20 from 59 and 54.
59 - 54 + 69 = 20 + 69 = 89 - 15 = 74
So, we've found our equation: 59 - 54 + 69 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 54 + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 17, 36, and 51 exactly once, with basic arithmetic to end up with 70. I'll start by examining the numbers to see if any of them can be used as they are or through an operation.
One observation is that if I subtract 17 from 51, I get 34. This is closer to our target number but not quite there. Next, I notice that 36 is not far from 34, which suggests a suitable way to get 70. 
If I add 36 to 34 (or 17 from 51), I get 50. To reach 70, I need to add 20. If I multiply 17 by 2, I get 34, which is good, but I need 6. Since I've already considered 36, 34, and 17, I need another approach.
Alternatively, multiplying 17 by 2 gives 34, and if I add 36 to that, I get 50. To reach 70, I need to add 20. If I divide 36 by 3, I get 12, and then to get to 70, I just need 58. 
When I divide 36 by 3, I get 12. Multiplying 12 by 4 should give me 48, and then adding 22 to reach 70. But that leaves no use for 51.
Another idea comes to mind - what if I divide 51 by 3, I get 17. Then to reach 70, I would need 53. Since I've already considered 51, I need another strategy.
Finally, I consider adding 17 to 51 first to get 68, and then adding 36 to reach 104 - this is too high. If I try subtracting 17 from 51 first, then subtracting the larger number from the result gives 34, and then subtracting the smaller remaining number from this result should give me 70.
17 - 51 = -34, and -34 - 17 = -51, which is not 70.
Let's try a final possibility, and reduce the steps. Subtract 17 from 51 and then add 36 to get the result.
51 - 17 = 34, and then 34 + 36 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 17) + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider how the numbers might add up or subtract to get close to 82. Multiplying or dividing might yield numbers closer to 82 or be necessary to create the final number.
Looking at the numbers 40, 18, and 24, 40 seems to be the biggest and could be the main contributor.
40 + 18 + 24 = 82, but we can't use each number once with just addition or should we?
Let's consider multiplication or division:
18 * 24 = 432, which is too large.
40 * 24 = 960, which is much too large.
Considering using the division next:
(40 * 24) / 18 = 53.33, which is close but not 82.
Now, let's try subtraction:
40 - 18 - 24 = 8
This is not 82, but it got us closer by a large margin.
Thinking about combining these, we should try the 40, 24 with subtraction and division:
(40 - 24) / 18 = 16 / 18, which is not 82.
Then, we can add the remaining number 18:
(40 - 24) / 18 + 18 = 16/18 + 18, simplifying this is complicated, so let's try another approach:
40 + (18 * 24 / 100) which is 40 + 0. 432, not an integer and not 82.
Finally, let's try a more complex thinking process:
(40 - 18) / 24 = 22 / 24 which is simplifying to 11/12, not helping directly.
Another approach could be:
(40 + 24) * (18 / 100) which simplifies to 64 * 0. 18, not a useful fraction.
I see I've been going in circles, so let’s return to basics:
Given the numbers must come out the same, 40 + 24 + 18 = 82, but not using each number once.
The goal seems seems to be tying them together in a single operation. Let me re-check these steps. Indeed adding them up works but conforms to the rules:
40 + 18 + 24 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 18 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 18, and 24. We need to create an equation that equals 82 using each number only once and any combination of basic arithmetic operations.
Since 82 is fairly close to 40 and 24, it seems likely that we'll use subtraction or addition to reach the desired result.
If we subtract 24 from 82, we're left with 58. Then, we need to make 58 from 40 and 18 using the allowed operations.
Adding 40 and 18 gives us 58, which is exactly what we need.
Thus, the equation would be: 82 = 40 + 18 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 18 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve an equation that equals 82 using the numbers 40, 18, and 24 exactly once, we need to try different combinations of arithmetic operations. One strategy could be utilizing multiplication or division to reach a higher number and then adjust with addition or subtraction.
Let's start by trying to use multiplication on any of the given numbers. Multiplying 24 by 3 would give 72, which is close to 82. Adding 10 might help reach 82.
Considering 40 as 4*10, we can use division and addition to get 10 from the remaining numbers, 18 and 24. But doing 18 / 24 will yield a fraction, so let's try 18 - 24.
18 - 24 = -6, and then adding 4*10 = 40 gives us:
(18 - 24) + (4 * 10) = -6 + 40 = 34, which is not 82.
Let's try using addition and subtraction differently. We can think of using 18 and 24 in combination. Adding 18 and 24 gives us 42. Now we need an extra 40 to reach 82. We can get 40 by using the number 40 without any operation.
So the equation becomes 18 + 24 + 40 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 18 + 24 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 30, 25, 71, and 97 to get a result of 81. 
I notice that 97 and 71 add up to 168, which is close to 169. If I could use subtraction between these two numbers, I might be able to adjust the result further.
Subtracting 71 from 97 gives 26. 
Now I have the numbers 30, 25, 26, and 81. 
The numbers 30 and 25 can be added together to make 55. 
Now I have the numbers 55, 26, and 81. 
The only way then to reach 81 using these numbers is 55 + 26. 
So the equation would be: 30 + 25 + (97 - 71) = 81.
</think>
<answer> (30 + 25) + (97 - 71)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 54 using the given numbers: 12, 85, 23, and 20. 
- Let's start by considering if any combination of the numbers themselves can achieve the result. None of the numbers alone or in pairs add up to 54.
- Now let's consider the possibility of using the operations. I can combine 85 - 23 to get 62, which is close to 54. Subtracting 8 from 62 seems a logical place to get 54. However, we don't have the number 8.
- I should consider if there's a way to get 8 from the provided numbers without using any of them directly. 20 - 12 = 8, this could work.
- So the equation becomes: (85 - 23) - (20 - 12) = 54.
</think>
<answer>(85 - 23) - (20 - 12)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number we want to reach: 58. 
Then I'll look at the numbers available: 60, 25, and 93. 
Since 93 is way above 58, it's better to try with 60 or 25.
If I use 60, I can subtract to get closer to 58. 
60 - 25 = 35, which is closer.
Next, I need to get from 35 to 58. 
I can add 35 + 23, but 23 is not in the set.
If I use 93, it doesn't help because subtracting 25 from it would give me 68, which is too high.
Considering I can use basic arithmetic operations, the best option is to use 25 and subtract it from 60 to get 35, and then add the missing 23, but since that number is not available, I'll need to look back.
Looking back, I see I need 23 which is 93 - 70. But 70 is not a number provided. No other combination seems to work with these numbers.
After trying the combinations, it's clear I need to rethink. The solution might involve different operations than what I thought initially.
A better approach might be using the number 93 in a different way. Let's try subtracting it from 60 and then adding 25.
93 - 60 = 33
Now, 33 + 25 = 58
</think>
<answer> 93 - 60 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to construct an equation that uses the given numbers 61, 60, and 75 to equal 76. 
One possible combination is: 75 - 60 + 61. 
However, 75 - 60 + 61 is actually 76, which meets our requirement.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 60 + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all the possible combinations of the three numbers using the given operations and try to see if they could fit the equation to equal 76. One way to start might be to consider multiplying or dividing and then subtracting or adding.
I see the number 75 - 60 equals 15, so I can work with the remaining 61.
By adding 61 to this result (15 + 61 = 76), we get our target number.
So the equation would be 61 + (75 - 60) = 76.
</think>
<answer> 61 + (75 - 60) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 36, 58, and 18 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to achieve the result of 76. 
Starting with 58 seems likely, as it's close to our target. Let's subtract 18 from 58 first: 58 - 18 = 40.
Now our equation looks like: 40 + x = 76. To isolate x, we subtract 40 from 76, which gives us: 76 - 40 = 36.
Therefore, we have the following equation: 58 - 18 + 36 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 18 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number I need to reach, which is 73. Next, I'll look at the numbers provided: 7, 20, and 60. A good starting point might be to use 60 as the base since it's the largest number and will help me get close to 73.
One approach could be to use 60 plus a smaller number that, when added to it, equals 73. Here, 20 fits this requirement since 60 + 20 = 80, which is 7 less than 73.
Therefore, we need to subtract 7 from 80 to get 73.
The equation then becomes: (60 + 20) - 7 = 73.
</think>
<answer>(60 + 20) - 7</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 70, 12, and 51. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 31.
I notice that 70 - 51 = 19, which is close to 31. By adding 12 to this result, I can reach 31.
Therefore, the equation would be: 70 - 51 + 12 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 51 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 55, and 96 that equals 94. Starting with the numbers as they are, let's consider operations that might help approach 94. Subtracting 55 from 96 gives me 41, which is close to 94. Now I need to get from 41 to 94 by using the third number, 53. Clearly, 53 - 41 = 12 is insufficient. Instead, I can add 53 to 41 to get 94. So the equation that works is 53 + (96 - 55) = 94.
</think>
<answer> 53 + (96 - 55) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 44, 73, 99, and 55. We need to create an equation that equals 37 using each number only once along with basic arithmetic operations.
- Starting with the numbers, let's try subtracting some of them: 99 - 73 = 26.
- Now, we need 10 more to reach 37 (26 + 10 = 37). 
- The only way to get 10 from the remaining numbers 44 and 55 is by subtracting 55 from 44 and then using the 55 we had left.
- So, we get 44 - 55 = -11.
- Now, if we take our 26 from earlier and subtract 11, we get 26 - 11 = 15.
- But we need 10, so let's see if we can break down the -11 further.
- We can get -11 by using the 55 + (-44). Therefore, -11 = 55 - 44.
- Now, if we substitute that, we get 26 - (55 - 44) and simplifying that gives us 26 - 55 + 44 = 15.
- We need to put in a negative sign so that we get the final result of -15, but this is close. However, we need to adjust the result to get 37.
- If we multiply 15 by -2, we get -30. But we need 37. 
- Considering further possibilities, if we take 55 and do 99 - 55, we get 44. And then do 44 - 73, we get -29, which is close, but not reaching 37.
- If we rearrange, let's consider: (55 - (99 - 73)) * -1 = 55 - 26 = 29. This isn't correct yet.
- Finally, a strategic approach: 99 - (73 + 55) = 99 - 128. This is incorrect.
- Upon reviewing all possibilities, another successful calculation is: 99 - 55 = 44, then 44 - 73 = -29, but we need to tweak it: (-55 + 99) - 73 = -29. This is still wrong.
- A simpler check shows us: (99 - 73) + (55 - 44) = 26 + 11 = 37.
</think>
<answer>(99 - 73) + (55 - 44)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 43, 20, and 15. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 43 + 15 is 58, which is close to 78. Then, 78 - 58 = 20. So, combining these parts, I can see that (43 + 15) + 20 = 78.
</think>
<answer>(43 + 15) + 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider possible operations that could lead to 22 using the numbers 95, 31, and 42. Since we are aiming to get 22, a subtraction operation seems promising, as it can adjust the higher numbers to the target number. 
Let's start by trying to subtract smaller numbers from 95. If we subtract 31 from 95, we get 64. Now we need to get from 64 to 22 using only 42. One way to do this is to subtract 42 from 64, which gives us 22. This seems to work.
So the equation would be: 95 - 31 - 42 = 22.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 31 - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 18, 72, and 44 to get a result of 46. 
Looking at the numbers, 72 - 44 is 28, which is close to 46 and leaves us with 18 to deal with.
Now, to reduce the number 28 to 46, might be adding an appropriate number. But 18 is much bigger than it needs to be. 
Let's consider division as it could reduce the values down. Dividing 72 by 44 gives us approximately 1.63, not exactly a useable number for reaching 46.
Next, I think about the subtraction of 18 from 44, which equals 26.
Now we need 8 more to reach the target of 46, which we can get from 72 ÷ 44's possible fractional part.
But rather than using the fraction, a simple approach is to look at using 18 and 44 directly with arithmetic operations.
What if we rearrange the idea and try using a fraction? We can use 72 ÷ (44 / 2) = 72 ÷ 22 = 3.27 which isn't exact. 
Then we think if maybe using 18 directly, 18 - 16 = 2, then 72 - 22 = 46.
So, using these numbers, the equation would be 72 - (44 - 18) = 46.
</think>
<answer> 72 - (44 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 20, 19, and 66. We need to use these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations to get 67.
One way to approach this is to start with the largest number, 66. We can try subtracting a smaller number from 66 to see if we can get closer to 67.
If we take 66 - 19 = 47, which is not 67. So 19 is too high.
Now let's try 66 - 20 = 46. Again, not 67.
Since 46 is still not 67, we can try to add numbers to it to reach 67. Adding 21 to 46 gives us 67, but 21 is not in our set of numbers.
What if we add 20 to 19? That would give us 39, which is still not 67. Adding 20 + 19 = 39 and then continuing to look for the final number to reach 67 isn't leading us closer.
We might need to consider intermediate steps. If we see how far from 67 we are, then adjust. Since 67 - 66 = 1 and we have a 19, something like 19 + 1 = 20, then we would need 66 - 4 = 62, but 4 is not in our numbers set either.
We can consider combinations of operations. For instance, if we start with 20 + 19 = 39 and try to get to 67, we'd need 67 - 39 = 28. We could then add 66 to 28, but that uses 66 twice. 
The only strategy left is to check if we could combine the numbers using subtraction and addition differently. Let's see if we can use the operations to directly get to 67:
19 + 66 - 20 = 65 would be close. To get to 67 from 65, we need to add 2. There is no direct way to combine 20 and 19 to get 2, but 20 - 18 = 2, and 18 isn't available. So this route isn't working.
Instead, another solution would be: 66 - 19 + 20 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 19 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the options we have. We need to use the numbers 2, 87, 7 exactly once, and they must combine to make 40. 
Let's begin by looking at the sum and difference of the numbers:
- 87 + 2 = 89 (too high)
- 87 - 2 = 85 (too high)
- 87 - 7 = 80 (too high)
- 87 + 7 = 94 (too high)
Multiplying or dividing these numbers alone won't get us exactly 40. Let's consider rearranging and combining them using multiplication and division.
Now, consider the pairs 2 and 7, 2 and 87, and 7 and 87:
- 7 * 2 = 14 (less than 40)
- 87 / 7 = 12.42 which isn't an integer
None of these options are exact, so let's consider other possible combinations like this. Let's try:
(87 - 7) / 2 = 40
Let's verify:
- 87 - 7 = 80
- 80 / 2 = 40
This works! Therefore, the equation is (87 - 7) / 2 = 40. </think>
<answer>(87 - 7) / 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what operations we can use. We need to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division on the numbers 63, 87, and 94 to get 56. 
We can start by checking if any of the numbers can be combined with the others using simple arithmetic. Clearly, no straightforward combination will give us 56 using just those three numbers. 
Next, let's look at the inverse operations - perhaps we can divide one of the numbers to get a useful intermediate result. 
If we take 94 / 2, we get 47, but this doesn't get us to 56 directly. 
Let's try 94 - 87 = 7. Now, we need to get 56 from 7 and 63. 
If we can use 63 - 7 = 56, then we have a solution. Let's check: 63 - 7 = 56.
So we have our solution: 63 - (94 - 87) = 56.
</think>
<answer>63 - (94 - 87)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the result of 89 using the numbers 33, 5, and 51. Let's start by considering if we can use multiplication or addition to reach this. The number 51 seems promising because adding 51 to 33 would give 84, which is close to 89. The difference between 89 and 84 is 5. Therefore, we need to make 5 using 5, which is straightforward with simple arithmetic.
51 + 33 = 84.
Now, to get to 89, we add 5 to 84: 84 + 5 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 33 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 38, 2, and 60 that equals 96. 
Given that 60 is a large number, it might be useful to subtract it from 96 to simplify the problem.
96 - 60 = 36. Now I have to express 36 using 38 and 2. 
If I take away 2 from 38, I get 36, which fits exactly.
So the equation becomes: (38 - 2) + 60 = 96.
</think>
<answer>(38 - 2) + 60</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 5, 69, and 14. We need to form an equation that equals 50. 
- 69 is a large number and seems difficult to manipulate to get close to 50.
- 14 can be subtracted from 50 to give 36. 
- 5, when used as it is, might help us reach the number 36.
Given 14 - 5 = 9, we need an additional 27 from 36 to reach 50. We can use 5 * 5 = 25, which is close to 27. But 5 * 5 = 25 doesn't leave enough to reach 50.
5 + 14 = 19, which is not the solution. But we can consider the reverse operation and use division or combination in a different way. Let's try using multiplication of 5 and 14.
5 * 14 = 70, but we need 50, so we can adjust by using subtraction instead of addition.
69 - 19 = 50. We achieved 19 by using 5 + 14. Hence, the equation would be:
69 - (5 + 14) = 50.
</think>
<answer> 69 - (5 + 14) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 98, 4, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 14 using these numbers exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations. 
Looking at 98 and 11, we see that 98 - 11 = 87. This is not close to 14, so let's try combining it with 4.
(98 - 11) + 4 = 87 + 4 = 91. This is still far from 14.
Now let's think about a different combination. What if we use 4 and 11 in a different way to possibly get closer to 14?
11 - 4 = 7. Now we have 98 and 7, but 98 - 7 = 91 still isn't right.
If we use 4 to modify 98 or 11, division or multiplication would seem plausible since 98 is much larger. 
Since we want to get to 14, dividing 98 by 7 would be a logical step. However, 7 isn't available directly, we should try to create it using 11 and 4.
11 - 4 = 7, so far, so good. Now let's divide 98 by 7.
98 / 7 = 14. This equals our target number 14.
Combining all of this together, we get: 98 / (11 - 4) = 14.
</think>
<answer> 98 / (11 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 28, 56, and 31. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to equal 53.
One way to start is by looking at the larger numbers 56 and 31, which if combined could give us a result close to our target:
56 - 31 = 25
Now we have 25 and we need to reach 53. We need to add 28 to this result:
25 + 28 = 53
So the expression using all three numbers is: 56 - 31 + 28
</think>
<answer>56 - 31 + 28</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 50, 57, and 53 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 46. Let's start by looking at the differences and sums of these numbers to see if we can simplify things.
- The difference between 57 and 53 is 4.
- The sum of 50 and 53 is 103.
- 57 - 53 + 50 - 53 = 4 implies we need to rearrange the operations slightly.
Notice that if we rearrange the numbers 50 and 53 and add 57 to them, we get 50 + 53 + 57 - 57. This shows that the equation should be 50 + 53 - 57.
</think>
<answer> 50 + 53 - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers I have: 25, 43, 56, and 55. I need to use them exactly once to make 67 using basic arithmetic operations. 
25 + 43 = 68 is close but then I need to subtract 1 to reach 67. 
56 - 55 = 1. 
So, combining 25 + 43 - (56 - 55) equals 67.
</think>
<answer> (25 + 43) - (56 - 55) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 16, 85, and 35. These don't immediately suggest a straightforward way to add up to 66 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Now, looking at the numbers more closely:
- 85 is relatively large, 66 is relatively small.
- 35 is in between 16 and 85, and it is not divisible by either 16 or 85 that we can use to get close to 66.
I recognize that mixing the operation might be necessary. If I look at subtraction:
- 85 - 35 = 50 (which is too far from 66), but this gives me a clue.
Now, looking at 16, if I can use it in a way to make up the difference:
- 85 - 35 = 50, then to get to 66, I need 16 + 50 = 66.
So, the equation will be 85 - 35 + 16.
</think>
<answer>85 - 35 + 16</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to generate an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 16, 85, and 35, each only once. Let's start by considering the possible operations:
- Adding 16 and 85 gives 101.
- Subtracting 35 from 85 gives 50.
- Multiplying 16 and 35 gives 560, which is too large for our target number.
- Dividing 85 by 16 or 35 will not give a whole number and won't help us reach 66 either.
Considering subtraction and addition could be a straightforward approach. 85 - 16 = 69, close but not 66. If we subtract a smaller number, we need to compensate, addition might work.
Let's try 85 - 16 + 35:
This gives 85 - 16 = 69, then 69 + 35 = 104 which is not 66. 
Instead, subtracting 35 from 85 and then adding 16 does not achieve 66 immediately.
That leaves 85 + 16 - 35:
This gives 85 + 16 = 101, then 101 - 35 = 66.
So, 85 + 16 - 35 = 66.
</think>
<answer>85 + 16 - 35</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination using the numbers 53, 70, and 66 that will give me 83. 
I see that 70 - 66 = 4. 
Now, if I add 53 to 4, I get 53 + 4 = 57 which is not equal to 83.
However, I can reverse the order of operations and do (70 - 66) + 53 = 4 + 53 = 57 + 26, but this introduces the number 26 which isn't in the set.
Another way to think about it is to see if I could use the numbers in a different sequence.
If I take 70 and subtract 53, I get 17. 
Then, if I add 66 to 17, I get 66 + 17 = 83.
This uses all unique numbers once and equals 83.
</think>
<answer> 66 + (70 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 64 using the numbers 32, 15, and 17. Let's consider these step by step:
1. One of these numbers must be multiplied by another to get close to 64. The number 32 is clearly a good candidate because 32 * 2 = 64, which is exactly what we need.
2. Since 32 is already in the form of the desired result, I can use 32 * 2 directly.
3. Now, I need to create a value of 2 using 15 and 17. There are a few ways to do this but the simplest one is to subtract 17 - 15 = 2.
4. So, the final equation that works is: 32 * (17 - 15).
</think>
<answer>32 * (17 - 15)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 33, 79, and 55 exactly once, that results in 57. 
Looking at the numbers, 79 seems quite large and 55 seems too small to subtract from or add to 33 to get 57. So, let's consider an operation that could bring the sum or difference closer to 57.
If I take 55 and subtract it from 79, I get 24. Now, I need to get to 57 from 24 using 33. 
Adding 33 to 24 gives me 57, which is what I need. 
So, the equation will be: 79 - 55 + 33 = 57.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 55 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 79, and 55 that results in 57. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try an equation like: (79 - 55) + 33
(79 - 55) equals 24.
Then adding 33 to 24 gives us 57.
(79 - 55) + 33 = 24 + 33 = 57
So the equation is correct and uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer>(79 - 55) + 33</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 9, 4, and 54. We need to create an equation that equals 10 using each number once and the basic arithmetic operations.
We see that 54 is a large number and 9 is relatively small. Subtracting 9 from 54 gives us 45, which is closer to 10, but still too far.
Let's try adding the smaller numbers: 9 + 4 = 13, which is far from 10.
Multiplying doesn't seem to get us closer to 10, as any product of 9, 4, and 54 will be much larger.
Let's try combining operations:
(54 - 9) / 4 = 45 / 4, which is not 10.
(9 - 54) / 4 only works as (9 - 54) / 4 = -4.5, not a valid solution.
So far, none of these operations seem to help us reach exactly 10. Let's try another approach - dividing:
54 / 9 = 6, but we need a difference of 4 to get 2, which isn't useful.
Let's try -9 + 4 + 54 = 49, which is still not 10.
Finally, let's try (54 - 9) / 4 + 4 = 45 / 4 + 4 = 11.25 + 4 = 10.25, which is close but not exact.
Let's reconsider the order of division and addition:
54 / (9 - 4) = 54 / 5 = 10.8, which is close but not exact.
The solution must involve another way to use these numbers. Let's try:
4 + (54 / 9) = 4 + 6 = 10.
</think>
<answer> 4 + (54 / 9) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 16, and 44 that equals 68. The operations we can use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's try different combinations of these operations.
- First, I notice that 40 + 16 + 44 = 100, which is too high. Combining 40 and 44 directly gives 84, which is close but needs to get to 68.
- Then, 40 - 16 = 24.
- Now we have 24 + 44 which is 68. So, the operations seem to work.
Therefore, the equation is 40 - 16 + 44 = 68.
</think>
<answer> 40 - 16 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the three numbers given: 40, 16, and 44. 
A straightforward way to reach 68 using these numbers could be through addition or subtraction.
1. If we add these numbers together, we get 40 + 16 + 44 = 100.
   That doesn't work as we need 68.
2. Subtracting the smallest number from the total gets us closer: 40 + 44 - 16 = 68.
This matches our target, so we can use - as our arithmetic operation between 40 and 44, and add 16 to reach 68.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 44 - 16 </answer>
