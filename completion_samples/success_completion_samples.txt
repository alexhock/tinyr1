<think> Clearly, we are dealing with the numbers 84, 18, and 3. Let's start by looking at each number and thinking about how to combine them to approach 30.
Given that 30 is very close to 84/2, it could mean we should consider division in the formulation.
Multiplying 18 and 3 would give us 54, much larger than 30, so let's skip that for now.
Using 18 and dividing by 3 obviously gives us 6, not what we need.
Now remember 84 is the largest number, so we should think about subtracting smaller numbers from 84 to reach closer to our answer.
Subtracting 18 from 84 gives us 66, and dividing this by 3 would give us:
66 / 3 = 22, still not 30.
To get closer to 30, we should try subtracting 18 from another large number and see where that gets us:
(84 - 18) / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22.
Clearly, 22 is too far from our target of 30, so we need to try using 18 in a different way.
Now, let's consider using the numbers in a different order and think about subtraction and multiplication:
Try 18 * 3 = 54 and then subtract 24 from 84. We need to find a number that when subtracted from 84 gives 30.
84 - 54 = 30. So if we do 84 - (18 * 3), we get 30.
There we go! That's the equation we are looking for.</think>
<answer> (84 - (18 * 3)) </answer>

==============
<think>Firstly, let's consider if we can create 79 directly using two of the given numbers. The number 72 is close but not quite there. Maybe the equation involves addition or subtraction of 7 or 8, but 27, 21, and 41 seem too large to achieve that directly. We can also evaluate division and multiplication, but these operations typically lead to numbers under 20 or above 80, which doesn't help us reach 79.</think>
<think>Given that the target number is far from the nearest starting number (27), let's work on manipulating numbers to get close. I notice that 27 + 41 = 68, which is far from 79 and too low. But if we explore the operations with our chosen numbers, we may find the solution.</think>
<think>Let's consider using 21 and 72 in conjunction with 41. An operation that multiplies or divides 21 or 41 could potentially lead us closer to 79. But we'll start from 21 and add to it using the remaining numbers.</think>
<think>Let's try adding 41 and see if we can reach closely to 79. That's 21 + 41 = 62. We need 17 more to make 79. Now, consider the possibility of reducing our goal by dividing or using the remaining numbers. We cannot divide 72, but we can subtract from 72.</think>
<think>Notice that 72 - 41 = 31, and if we add 27, this gives 31 + 27 = 58. Now we need 21 more to reach 79, which is exactly the sum of 21 and 72 - 41.</think>
</think>
<answer> (21 + 72 - 41) + 27 </answer>
</answer>

==============
<think> Since we want to arrive at 30 and given the numbers 24, 65, and 59, intuitively, we need to utilize some subtraction. The number 65 is significantly higher than 30, so it seems like it might subtract a substantial amount from it at one point to make 30. Given 59 is close to 30, we could consider the feasibility of it as well. </think>
Let's start by looking at the possibility of subtracting 59 from 65 to get a reasonable value to work with.
<think> Adding 24 to the result of subtracting 59 from 65 should keep us moving towards our target of 30. </think>
<think> If we perform 65 - 59 = 6 first, then adding 24 to this result: 6 + 24 = 30, this would give us our desired result. Hence, the equation is: 65 - 59 + 24 = 30. </think>
<answer> 65 - 59 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication and division first since these can yield larger numbers (like 72) that can be closer to 12. The numbers we have are 72, 2, and 3. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6, and then dividing 72 by 6 gives us 12. Thus, the equation could be 72 / (2 * 3) which equals 12. </think>
<answer> 72 / (2 * 3) </answer>

==============
<think> Since the target is 47, and I am aiming to use each number, 33, 84, 38, and 34 only once, I'll try different permutations of the numbers and operations. Let's start with multiplication and division since they can significantly increase or decrease values to make the target more achievable.</think>
<think> Let's consider the pattern with 84: if we try to use this in conjunction with another number, like 33 and 38, we should see what multiplication would yield. 84 * 38 = 3212, which is already large and far from our target. Dividing 84 by any of these numbers will not help as the results will be under 47. </think>
<think> Let's move to operations between 33 and 38. Adding or subtracting these numbers yields: 38 - 33 = 5 or 33 - 38 = -5. We want the result to fit into how we can use the remaining numbers, 84 and 34, to reach 47. </think>
<think> So, we need to somehow manipulate 33, 38, and 84 with 34 to get 47. Adding 34 to 33 + 38 = 71 and then dividing by 84 does not work since we only have one number 84 to divide into 71+34. </think>
<think> Now let's try another combination using operations. If we divide 84 by 34, we get 2.47, which is not an integer and hence not useful here. Let's look at another combination considering subtraction: if we subtract 38 from 84, we get 46, close to our target but slightly above. We need to make 47, so an adjustment is required. </think>
<think> I believe the path is to take 38 from 84 and then use the subtraction approach with 33 and 34. If we subtract 33 from 34, we get 1, which is not immediately aligned, but subtracting 1 from 46 gives us 45, not quite there. Consequently, we need to find how 84 - 38 = 46 can be adjusted by 33 and 34 to be 47.</think>
<think> I realize adding 33 to 46 doesn't quite work. But subtracting 33 from 46 (another approach for another problem) would give us steps where I can align the remaining numbers. 34 is nearly equivalent to subtracting 34 from 46. Thus, (84 - 38) + (34 - 33) = 46+1 = 47. </think>
<answer> (84 - 38) + (34 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> 
Firstly, I need to create an equation using the numbers 72, 5, and 49 that results in 28, and each number can only be used once. I'll start by analyzing which combination of arithmetic operations might help. The number 72 seems too large to get down to 28 using multiplication or division with 49 or 5. Therefore, I will focus on using subtraction and addition.
</think>
<answer>
(72 - 49) + 5
</answer>
Let me work through the steps:
<think>
(72 - 49) + 5 = 23 + 5
</think>
<answer>
(72 - 49) + 5 = 23 + 5 = 28
</answer>
Therefore, the final equation is <answer>(72 - 49) + 5</answer>.

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 83 using the numbers 98, 92, and 77, with each number used only once and basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with the numbers, I see that 98 is the largest number, so I should consider what it could be subtracted by or added to. Subtracting or dividing by smaller numbers could get me closer to 83.
First, let's try to use addition. If I can find a way to get 98 - something close to 83, I might be on to something.
98 - 92 = 6, 98 - 77 = 21, 92 - 77 = 15
None of these closely match 83. Then let's try a tricky addition.
98 - 92 = 6 and if I use 92 + 77, I could get 75 + 9, 75 + some other numbers, etc.
Let's try: 77 + 92 = 169 - 86 = 83, but 86 isn't in the list of numbers.
What if I consider multiplication with one of the numbers:
(92 * 1) + 77 = 92 + 77 = 169 / 2 = 84.5 not 83.
Then, let's consider if combining subtraction and addition or multiplication works. If I first consider taking away 92 from 98, and then use the result with 77:
98 - 92 = 6, 6 + 77 = 83
This is the right path. </think>
<answer>(98 - 92) + 77</answer>

==============
<think> First, I would like to simplify the consideration of multiplication and division because they significantly affect the outcome and are more likely to achieve a precise sum when applied to the smallest remaining numbers. That leaves addition and subtraction. If I were to consider the subtraction first, I might want to reduce the larger numbers to make reaching 70 feasible. </think>
Given the numbers [5, 17, 84, 8], subtracting the smallest number (5) from the largest (84) leaves 79. If only addition is considered, adding 8 would bring us close to 70, making 84 - 5 + 8. This doesn't directly solve the problem, but it gets very close. I can adjust by alternately using subtraction and addition.</think>
<think> Considering the equation 84 - 5 + 8 - 17 = 70, the steps are as follows:
1. Start with 84.
2. Subtract 5, we get 79.
3. Add 8, making it 84 + 8 = 92.
4. Subtract 17, we obtain the final sum of 70.
This adheres to the rule of using each number exactly once and follows the mathematical operations as desired.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 5 + 8 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 3 and 77. While 77 is considerably bigger than 64, adding or subtracting 3 could be a starting point. Multiplying 3 by any number would make the result larger, and dividing 77 by 3 would not necessarily reduce the number to 64. Let's begin with the subtraction idea: 77 - 3 = 74. Now, we need to get the remaining 10 to reach 64. Substituting 74 with 10 and then subtracting will get us closer to 64: 74 - 10 = 64. </think>
<answer> (77 - 3) - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 51, 33, and 57. We need to combine them using arithmetic operations to achieve the result 27. 33 seems to be the easiest to use in this case because it's a neat round number. So I will use addition and subtraction with the other two numbers to get to 27. </think>
Since we need to get 27 and 33 is close, let's see if we can use 33 in any way to help us reach the result.
<think> I need to subtract from 33 to get 27, as 33 - 6 = 27. Now I need to find if I can generate 6 using the other numbers, 51 and 57. </think>
Now, let's look at using 51 and 57.
<think> I can subtract 51 from 57 to make 6. So the expression becomes 57 - 51 = 6. Now, putting this all together the equation looks like this:
33 - (57 - 51) = 27
</think>
<answer> 33 - (57 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the provided numbers [87, 18, 29] using basic arithmetic operations to make the expression equal to 40. I'll start by examining the numbers closely to find a combination that might work.
I notice that 87 and 18 do not make 40 easily when combined directly. I think I might need to use 29 in some operation. The numbers 87 and 18 can be manipulated by subtracting 29 from 87, resulting in 58, but then I need to subtract another 18 to get down to the target of 40.
So, this might be a good equation: 58 - 18 = 40.
But we are restricted to using each number only once. Therefore, let's see if 87 can be transformed in another way, maybe subtracting 29 from 87 and then subtracting the result of 18:
(87 - 29) - 18 = 40.
This satisfies the requirement of using each number only once and equals 40.
</think>
<answer>(87 - 29) - 18</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's think about what we need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide by to get from these numbers to 56. Given the numbers 19, 43, and 80, it seems we might need to use division or subtraction to adjust the total down. Multiplication or addition could make the numbers too large or too small.</think>
<think>Considering 43 as a significant starting point, if we can bring the other numbers close to 56, we might consider 80 to be our target after some manipulation. 
If we subtract 19 from 43 first, we get 24. Now, we need to get to 56, so we need to add 32 to 24, which is achieved by 80 - 48, but 48 is not one of the original numbers. 
Instead, let's think of the inverse: to get from 24 to 56 in one step, we need to add 32. We can see that 32 is 4 times 8, and 8 can be generated from 80 - 72, but none of these are part of the initial list either. 
So, let's think about just getting 43 to be close to 56 with the remaining operation. </think>
<think>80 - 43 = 37, which is not quite 56, but we can still use it. Now, to get from 37 closer to 56, we can try using the 19. 56 - 37 = 19. This can be seen as multiplying 19 by 1, but we have no other number to do this directly, so we'll use division or another approach.
If we examine 80 - (43 * 1) = 37 again in a different context, we see that we can invert the equation, thus returning to our original numbers in another method. Doing (80 - 43) + 19 = 56.
</think>
<answer>(80 - 43) + 19</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the three numbers available: 88, 98, and 57. The goal is to produce a result of 67 using basic arithmetic operations, with one of each of these digits plus the operations allowed. Let's try some combinations starting with subtraction first, as it often simplifies large numbers quickly. </think>
<think> Subtracting 57 from 98 gives us 41. Now we have 88 and 41 to work with. If we subtract 41 from 88, we get 47. However, we need 67, not 47. </think>
<think> Trying addition, if I add 57 to 98, I get 155, which is far from 67. As multiplication and division ensure the number we get is either a large or a small fraction of the starting number, I will focus on the addition and subtraction paths further. </think>
<think> Moving on, if I try another subtraction option: since 98 is quite close to 88, I might need to think about adding or multiplying strategically. Combining 57 and 88 with addition or multiplication does not simplify effectively towards 67. </think>
<think> Another approach is to think about what combination of operations would lead to 67 directly. Notice that operating with subtraction will help in creating the final result more efficiently. If I try to use 88 and 98 directly, I can consider 98 minus 88 equals 10. Now, if I add 57 to 10, I get 67. </think>
<answer> 98 - 88 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to arrive at the number 84 using the numbers 90, 57, and 51. Let's first try multiplication and division, as they have more significant effects when used with the available numbers.
Multiplying 90 by any of the other two numbers would give a product much larger than 84. Sure, 90 * 57 = 5130 and 90 * 51 = 4590 are far beyond 84.
Next, let's consider division. If I divide 90 by 57 or 51, the results will be less than 2, which certainly won't help reach 84. In fact, 90 / 51 and 90 / 57 both give numbers too low to interact with 57 or 51 to reach our target.
Multiplication and division by these numbers aren't yielding results that bring us close to 84. Let's then reconsider addition and subtraction, as these operations can bring us closer to 84 in a manageable way.
Adding or subtracting 57 or 51 from 90 or 51 does not bring us to 84. For instance, 90 - 57 = 33, 90 - 51 = 39, 57 + 90 = 147, and 51 + 90 = 141.
Let's try combining operations in another way. Given that 90 is the largest number, we might try 'subtracting' 57 and 'adding' 51, and check if this combination can lead us to 84.
</think>
<think> Performing the combination 90 - 57 + 51 gives 84. Now I confirm that this aligns with the equation we need.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 57) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will take a look at the numbers provided: 38, 59, and 12. My goal is to get 85 using each of these numbers exactly once, and only using basic arithmetic operations. I should note that there may be multiple solutions, but I will focus on a logical sequence that reflects a straightforward path to the solution. 
An obvious first step would be to check the sum of all three numbers as the numbers are not large and two might help get close to 85. Their sum is 38 + 59 + 12 = 109, which is not 85 but is closer. The difference is 24, which might be achieved by subtraction. 
I will start by substraction 12 from the sum. </think>
<answer>(38 + 59) - 12</answer>
This gives us 97 - 12, which is 85.</answer>
</think>
<answer> (38 + 59) - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I will first examine what operations need to be performed on the numbers to equal 97. Given 38 and 66, adding or subtracting these numbers do not seem to lead to 97. Multiplying them results in 2,448, which is way too high, and dividing them results in 0.53846, which is too low. Therefore, multiplication and division by these numbers don't work.
Considering 7, if I add it to 38, I get 45, which isn't close to 97. If I subtract 7 from 38, I get 31, which is also not correct.
Next, I think about how 7 and 66 could be used together. Multiplying 7 by 66 gives me 462, which is much too high. Subtracting 7 from 66 gives me 59, which is closer but still far from the target of 97.
Since I need to reach 97 from 59, I should try to use subtraction or addition to adjust, but my available number is 38. If I add 38 to 59, I get 97. Therefore, one equation that satisfies the condition is 38 + 59 - 66 = 97.
</think>
<answer>38 + (66 - 7)</answer>

==============
<think> We are using the numbers 19, 14, and 87 and need to arrive at 54. First, let's consider if we can use any of these numbers as part of a subtraction or combination for quicker results.
Given the numbers, subtraction might not be immediately useful as it would not be straightforward to get close to 54, even when using -87.
Multiplication and division on these individual numbers also don't seem to be leading us to 54 easily.
Let's then consider combinations. If we use 19 and 14, their sum is 33, and then subtracting from 87 gives us 54. So, 87 - 19 - 14 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 19 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers [11, 58, 49] to create an equation that equals 96. I notice that 58 and 49 are quite large numbers, so they might be the target or a part of it.
Let's consider if multiplication of 58 and 49 would lead us close to or exactly equal 96. Calculating 58 * 49:
58 * 49 = 2882, which is far from 96.
Next, let's consider potential subtractions with these numbers. Let's consider:
58 - 49 = 9.
This much closer, but still far from 96. Let's see if we can use the 11 and try other combinations:
11 + 85 = 96, but 85 is not a number closest to 58 or 49.
We need to consider division. Let's explore:
58 / 49 = 1.183... This doesn't help as it's not close to a whole number.
Thus, we need to use the remaining number 11 and see if we can combine it with the other numbers:
(58 - 49) + 11 could potentially work.
58 - 49 = 9.
9 + 11 = 20, which is not equal to 96.
Now let's arrange them in a way where a different combination could work:
Considering (58 + 49) - 11 for now, because we need to get to 96.
(58 + 49) = 107.
107 - 11 = 96.
This is the break we needed.
</think>
<answer>(58 + 49) - 11</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by considering the numbers and the arithmetic operations. I notice that the final result needs to be 88, and we need to use all three numbers: 57, 16, and 47 exactly once. 
Working on these, I recall that multiplication could yield a large number quickly. Let's see if multiplying 57 and 16 gives a number close to or exactly 47 times some other number.
\[ 57 \times 16 = 912 \]
This is too large, so I need to reduce the result. 
Now, let's consider dividing instead. If I divide 912 by 11, I get:
\[ 912 / 11 \approx 82.91 \]
This is far from our target of 88, so a different approach is needed.
I recall that 47 could be subtracted or added to the division result, or we can think in reverse. What if I take 47, multiply it by the fraction of 16/57, and adjust accordingly?
\[ \text{Let} \quad 47 \times \frac{16}{57} = x \]
Calculating the value of x:
\[ x = 47 \times \frac{16}{57} = \frac{752}{57} \approx 13.14 \]
I need a number close to 55-13. 14 = 41. Now, taking the difference between 88 and 41 to get 47.
Using the equation:
\[ 88 = 47 + (57 - 16) \]
Now, let's express this in the required format.
</think>
<answer> (57 - 16) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll go through the numbers: 46, 48, and 39. I want to arrive at 37 using basic arithmetic operations on these numbers.
I can easily see that 46 + 48 doesn't yield 37. Moving on.
48 - 46 gives 2, which isn't useful for our goal. Let's try a different approach.
48 - 39 = 9. Now I have 9, 46, and 48 to work with, and 37 is our target.
46 - 9 = 37. Now I have arrived at 37. Let's confirm the whole expression.
(The expression would be 46 - (48 - 39)). </think>
<answer> 46 - (48 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers that are closer to 55. Here we are looking for a combination that equals 55 using the numbers 66, 70, and 51.
Using subtraction, if we take 70 from 66, we get 4. So, (70 - 66) = 4. 
Now we need to get from 4 to 55. Adding 51 to 4 does not work as it gives us 55.
If we use a different approach, we can realize that (70 - 66 = 4). Now, to reach 55, we can try another combination. Since we can't use 70, let's try to find something with 51 to get us closer.
Considering multiplication or division with 51, dividing 51 by 51 equals 1 and adding this to 4 does not give us 55.
Lastly, let's consider the possibility of using simple addition or subtraction. With 51 being larger and 66 closer to our target, we can look at subtraction:
(70 - 66) + 51 = 4 + 51 = 55. </think>
<answer>(70 - 66) + 51</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need an equation that can reach 66 using the available numbers: 27, 3, and 90. A good strategy here is to use multiplication or division to get closer to 66, since dealing with 66 itself is too high for our available numbers. Let's multiply 90 by some number to reach this value. If I multiply 90 by 2, it equals 180, which is quite far from 66. If I multiply 90 by 1. 5, I get 135, still not close enough but moving in the right direction. Multiplying by 1. 133333... is too precise. Let's try another route.
Since 90 is pretty large, using it as a base, I could subtract or add other numbers to reach 66. If I divide 90 by 1. 428571... (which is 3/2), I get 64, which is close. Now, if I subtract 3, I get 61, and if I subtract 27, I get 34. That's nearer to 66, but still not there.
So let's see if I can make another small adjustment. What if I add 3 to 64 (i.e., 90/2. 667) and then add 2? That would be 65. And to reach 66, I just need to add 1. Now, 1 cannot be made from our numbers, so I need to think of a way to get 65 and then add 1. It seems multiplication and division are leading me astray. Let's switch to addition. If I take 90 and add 3, I get 93. Now, I can subtract 27 to reach 66: 93 - 27 = 66. </think>
<answer> 90 + 3 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll need to figure out how to use the numbers 64, 8, and 94 to get the result of 38. 
Considering the target number we need to achieve is 38, I think one effective way is to use the largest number (94) to reduce the target number closer to 38. Let's think of using subtraction here.
Using 94 - 64 gives us 30. Now, to get the final result of 38, we will need to add 8 to 30. This fits all the given constraints - we are using each number only once and performing valid arithmetic operations.
So the equation will be: (94 - 64) + 8.
</think>
<answer>(94 - 64) + 8</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should recognize that the result we need to achieve is 59, which is quite far from the smallest number, 1. Since 20 is the largest number and has both addition and multiplication potential, I should start by examining how 20 can be used to reach closer to 59.
20 can be multiplied by 3 to yield 60, which is just 1 short of 59. But that will require 59/3 which isn't an integer, so it's out. We should consider doing 20 * 3 and then subtracting 1 from the result.
1 * 3 equals 3. Subtracting 1 from 3 leaves us with 2.
Therefore, 20 * 3 - 1 = 59.
So, the equation is 20 * 3 - 1.
</think>
<answer>20 * 3 - 1</answer>

<think> For our numbers [42, 83, 23], the final result we need is 18. The first number 42 seems big enough that it can help get us closer to 18, and the other two numbers are small enough to fine-tune the result.
Let's consider the relationship between the numbers. By inspection, 83 - 42 - 23 would give us something between 0 and 18. We need 18, so we can use multiplication or division to scale it up. 

Now, we see we need to reduce the number to 18, and 83-42-23 = 18. So, we need to make this equation simpler using the available operations and numbers.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 42 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers: 68, 53, and 91. To get to 76, we need to perform some basic arithmetic operations. 
Since 91 is the largest and furthest from 76, it's possible we might need to take 91 away to get close to 76. But 91 - 76 = 15, so that wouldn't help.
Next, let's consider subtraction between 68 and 53. This gives us 15, but again, we need to get to 76.
What if we tried using multiplication and division? Considering 68 * 1 = 68, 68 / 1 = 68, and 91 / 1 = 91. We can use 91 to reach our target, but we'll need to find a way to add or subtract to get to 76. 
Let's see:
- If we divide 91 by 1 (which is 91) and then multiply by 1 (which is 1), we get 91 * 1 = 91. So, we're still far from 76.
- If we take 68 and divide by 1 (which is 68) and then add 53 (which is 53 + 68 = 121), we're still not in the right ballpark. But 68 / 1 = 68, and 68 + 53 = 121.
Now we see that 68 + 53 = 121, but we need to get to 76. This means we need to subtract 45 from 121 to reach 76.
We know that 91 can't be directly used here since it's much larger. Let's think of other operations. Perhaps we can subtract 68 or 53 from 91. 
If we perform 91 - 68 = 23, that's not 76. Let's try 91 - 53 = 38. Still not there.
Finally, let's combine these into one equation: 91 - 68 = 23, then 23 + 53 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 68 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the equation which should use only the numbers 27, 38, and 78 once and lead to the result 67. 
Let's start with simple operations combining these numbers. One approach is to see if adding or subtracting these numbers can almost equal 67.
Combining 78 - 38 = 40, but I need to reach 67, so this isn't quite right. Now, considering multiplication or division with the remaining number 27, as in 38 * 27/27 = 38, another 27 isn't allowed. 
Next, let's think of combining 27 and 38 with subtraction or addition. If I add 27 and 38, it equals 65, which is closer to 67. Then I need two additional units to reach 67. Maybe the remaining 27 can help this way: 65 + 27 - 38 = 64 + 27 - 38, but this isn't equal to 67. 
Instead, let's experiment with more complex combinations. Adding 27 and 38 gives 65. We could consider 65 plus some operation with 27. Now, 65 / 27 isn't an integer, but 65 - 27 = 38. Plugging this into the equation, we get 65 - 27 + 27 = 65, and adding -27 (which is not allowed) or rearranging like 65 + (27 - 27) = 65 again doesn't help.
Thinking about multiplication and division, 78 * 38/27 = 10868/27, which is not a whole number, so I can't directly use this. Let's try (78/27) * 38 = 38 * 38/27 = 1444/27, again not a whole number.
Lastly, a recombination is needed. Let's try a different numerical addition and subtraction approach: (78-27) + 38 = 51 + 38 = 89, which is too high; subtracting should get us closer. Let's try (78-38) + 27 = 40 + 27 = 67, perfect!
</think>

<answer> (78 - 38) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> The target is 89 and we have the numbers 96, 73, 29, 95. We need to use all numbers exactly once and only the basic arithmetic operations are allowed. 96 and 95 are higher than 89, 73 and 29 are more on the lower side, so there may be a combination for reaching 89. First, consider what subtraction or addition between 96 and 95 gives us close to or equal to 89:
96 - 95 = 1,
95 - 96 = -1.
Neither of these get us close to 89. Next, we should consider multiplication. Notice 73 * 2 = 146 and 73 * 1 = 73 where both are too large for our needs. Now, let's consider 73 divided by 29 or 29 divided by 73:
73 / 29 is approximately 2.517 and 29 / 73 is approximately 0. 397. Neither of these operations come close to necessary to our target 89.
Considering the smaller numbers 29 and 73, let's test: we can obtain 29 * 3 = 87, and we need 89. If we reconfigure 29 + 3 = 32 and then 73 + 32 = 105 which is more than we need. Also, we can eliminate the need for 32 by finding the leftover after subtraction.
The number 73 is higher than 89, so let's think if we can get the difference. If we use 96 and subtract 73, we get:
96 - 73 = 23.
We're still far short of getting 89, and adding any numbers or operations might not yield the needed result. Let's reconsider using the other lower number 29 and 73 together in different ways:
(96 - 73) * 29 / 1000 is unlikely since 1000 is too large for an effective operation result.
96 - 73 - 29 does not reach the target either.
There's still 95 left, it seems we should find a way to use that and 29 or 73 in an operation. Multiplying or adding might work:
(95 - 73) * 29 = 22 * 29 = 638.
That's too large. But by adjusting, we can:
29 * 73 / 95 = 2123 / 95 = 22.468 which is around 22, and then:
96 - 22 = 74, 74 + 15 = 89.
But there's no way to get 22 from provided numbers.
Looking at the equation again, we need 22 and are short, and:
73 * 29 / 95 = 2227 / 95 = 23. 35 is closer but still leaving us short.
Considering 96 - 95 leaves 1.
Then, we need to reach 87 by some operations with 29 and 73.
Thus the original and added 1 from 96 - 95 can be adjusted:
73 + 29 + 1 = 103, which is not our target.
Therefore, the final closest combination from given number operations logic:
(96 - 73) * 29 / 1000 is not applicable, 29 * 73 is too large, 73 - 29 = 44 which is not enough, we're left with:
96 - 73 - 29 + 1 = 95 - 102 = -7.
But we need 89, so let's reiterate:
96 - 73 - 29 + 95 = 89.
Hence the final equation that equals 89 is: 96 - 73 - 29 + 95 = 89.</think>
<answer> 96 - 73 - 29 + 95 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the arithmetic operations we can use to approach 83. Since the numbers to operate on are 68, 95, and 80, a useful calculation could be the sum of 68 and 80, then adjusting that result to get to 83 with 95. Let's start with 68 + 80 = 148. We need to reduce it to 83 using 95. The logical way to do this operation given the numbers is subtraction, where 148 - 95 could yield the solution. However, with the current setup, we're 95 - 148 = -53, which is not correct.
Another approach could be to consider 95 as a multiplier and see if we can get closer to 83 by adjusting the first two numbers. Let's try 95 / 1 = 95. This is clearly not the approach we need either, as we need to reduce from 148 to 83. Taking this one step further, we realize that by manipulating 68 + 80, maybe we can use multiplication or division differently.
Given we need to get to exactly 83, let's try the breakdown as 95 + 68 - 80. This is because we know 95 and we need to adjust this to come closer to 83. Performing the operation, 95 + 68 - 80 = 83. </think>
<answer>95 + 68 - 80</answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 24, 73, and 20 that equals 69. We can start by calculating the differences and sums between these numbers, as well as looking at the multiplication and division operations. As we know, we can only use each number once.
1. First, let's see if we can subtract any of the numbers from 73 or add 20 to it to approach 69.
   - 73 - 24 = 49
   - 73 - 20 = 53
   - 73 - 20 + 20 = 73
   - Adding 20 to 73 doesn't help us reach the required number accurately. Subtraction seems promising since we can further reduce the difference to reach 69.
2. Let's try subtracting 20 from 73 first, and then checking if we can get to 69 by calculating with 24:
   - From above, we have 73 - 20 = 53.
   - We need 53 - ? = 69. But this subtraction is too large, so let's try the other possible combination.
   - Next, let's see if we can take 24 away from 73 in a way that helps get us to 69.
   - 73 - 24 = 49, and then 49 - 20 = 29, and 29 - 10 = 19 and we are still far away from 69.
   - Let's try to take 24 from 73 and then use 20 to adjust the result.
   - 20 can be subtracted from 24 to make it 73 - (24 - 20) = 20.
     This results in 73 - 24 + 20 = 69, which equals 69.</think>
<answer> 73 - 24 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 51, 59, and 83 where each number can only be used once, I'm going to try various combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the possibility of subtraction and addition since the numbers seem close to 75. I'll check if subtracting 59 from 83 will result in a number close to the one we need to add to 51 to reach 75.
83 - 59 = 24.
Now we need another number that can be obtained by adding 51 to 24, resulting in 75.
51 + 24 = 75.
So our numbers and operations are combined to give us 83 - 59 + 51 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 59) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider using addition and subtraction to try to get close to 58 with the given numbers. Taking a look at 69 and 16, their sum would be 85, which is 27 more than 58. 
Now, think about reducing this by using 5. We know 59 is just 16 short of 75 (which could be derived from 16 * 5) and 69 divided by 1 is 69. The difference between 59 and 69 is 10. Thus, we would need to remove 20 from our sum of 85 to get to 58, which can be accomplished by subtracting 16 from 69 and adding 5. Therefore, the equation would be: 69 - 16 + 5 </think>
<answer> 69 - 16 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how to make 50 using the numbers 2, 2, and 50. One way to approach this is to look for a combination that involves at least one of the zeros which could be derived from the number 50. We know that 50 / 2 = 25. Also, 50 + 2 = 52 but we need to reduce that to 50. Let's see if we can subtract 2 from this result. If we take 52 - 2 we get 50. So, I can form this equation using the numbers available.</think>
<answer> (50 + 2) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 53, 62, and 2 to create an equation that equals 22. The goal is to do this using basic arithmetic - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number must be used just once.
Let's start by thinking about the 2. It's a small number close to the target 22, so it might be useful in a subtraction or division.
Now I will consider the other two numbers: 53 and 62. Given that 22 is relatively small compared to these two numbers, it's possible that division or some combination of the other two numbers can significantly reduce the value. 
Let's test division. 62/2 = 31, which is closer to 22 than 53, but still isn't there. Now if we subtract 31 from 53 we have 22, which is the number we want. So, let's form the equation based on this.
</think>
<answer> (53 - 62 / 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add the numbers to see if I can get closer to 77. Starting with 70 and 48, I get:
70 + 48 = 118, which is too large. Next, I'll try combining the other two numbers 70 and 55:
70 + 55 = 125, still too large. Lastly, I'll try adding 48 and 55:
48 + 55 = 103, still quite a bit off. Now, I'll think about subtraction to reach the number. By subtracting the smallest number (48) from the largest (70):
70 - 48 = 22. This is still not enough, but it's closer. Now I'll try using the difference found (22) with 55:
77 - 55 = 22. This works! Therefore, we can use the equation:
77 = 55 + (70 - 48) </think>
<answer> 55 + (70 - 48) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 77, 86, and 89 to get 98. From the given numbers, 89 and 86 are close to 98. So I will consider adding 86 and 89 first, which gives me:
86 + 89 = 175
Now, 175 is much higher than 98, so I need to do a negative operation to get closer to 98. However, if I subtract 77 from 175, I get:
175 - 77 = 98
This way, all numbers are used once and the equation equals 98. </think>
<answer> 86 + 89 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> The numbers we have to work with are 34, 25, and 53. Our goal is to reach the number 44 using these numbers only once and any combination of arithmetic operations. 
Considering the size of the numbers, we might need to look for a subtraction or a division to reduce the value.
Let's try subtracting 34 and 25 first:
34 - 25 = 9
Now, we are left with 9 and 53. We can check how to utilize these to arrive at 44. Subtracting 53 from 9 won't help, and adding or multiplying won't give us 44 as the final result.
Now let's try to think of division. If we divide 53 by 13, we will get 4 with a remainder, but we cannot use 13. Let's try dividing by other numbers.
Dividing 53 by 25 yields 2 with a remainder of 8, which doesn't help us. Let's try dividing 53 by 34:
53 / 34 = 1.56 (not an integer, so this is not viable)

Given the options we have, let's try another approach:
We see that (53 - 25) = 28, which, given that we want to subtract this amount from 34 to get 44, we can rearrange the equation.
34 - 28 = 6.
Now, if we do 6 * 4, we get 24. That means:
53 - 34 = 19,
19 + 24 = 43, and if we do it a final time:
43 + 1 = 44
So we need another operation to get from 24 to 44.
24 + 20 = 44
We've already used 34, 25, and 53, and 20 cannot be made using just these numbers and operations, and shouldn't use a new number.
Thus, we now need to use the numbers in a combination that doesn't violate the rule that each number can be used only once. An alternative might be to use what we have left and add them up.
Considering:
53 - 34 = 19
19 + 25 = 44
This satisfies the conditions.</think>
<answer> 53 - 34 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I want to form an equation using the numbers 65, 20, 3 that results in 42. To achieve this, I will start by deducting smaller numbers from a larger number. The first step could be 65 - 20, which equals 45. Now I have to reduce by 3 to get to 42. I can do that by subtracting 3 from 45. (65 - 20) - 3 = 42. Now the equation using the numbers once is: 65 - 20 - 3 = 42. </think>
<answer> (65 - 20 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I see we have the numbers 36, 22, and 58 to work with and need to find an equation that equals 44 using basic arithmetic operations. 
- First, let's consider the numbers in relation to 44. We can try subtracting 22 from 36: 
  36 - 22 = 14
- Having 14, we can add 58 to get closer to 44:
  14 + 58 = 72
- Since 72 is too large, let's subtract 72 from 44:
  44 - 72 = -28 (Not what we want)
- As a next approach, negative numbers could also be considered. If we subtract 36 from 58:
  58 - 36 = 22
- But then, if we add 22 to 22, we don't match 44:
  22 + 22 = 44 (This works! )
- So, the equation combining these steps would be 58 - 36 + 22 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 36 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider multiplying and dividing, as these are more likely to reduce the range of numbers (26, 36, 43) into manageable targets. I'll begin by trying to use 26 or 36 as the result, as they're in the middle.
- Using 36: The numbers that can be combined to give 36 are 43 - 7, but 7 is not among the numbers. 36 = 26 + 10, but 10 is not among the numbers. 36 can be written as 43 - 7, but 7 is not in the list. 36 cannot be formed using the numbers given in only one way.
- Using 26: I can subtract 43 - 26 = 7. But again, 7 is not among the numbers.
- It seems calculating with the numbers given to get 36 is impossible. Now, I'll look for the options left: 43 and 36. 
- For getting 33, 43 - 10 = 33, and 10 is 36 - 26. This means we could use 43 - (36 - 26) = 33.
</think>
<answer> 43 - (36 - 26) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to structure the equation in a way that uses the numbers 38, 19, and 3 only once, to get the result of 54.
One approach is to see if we can combine numbers or their operations to get close to 54. 38 and 19 add up to 57, which is close to 54 but a bit too large. If we subtract 3 from 57, it becomes 54. The equation could look something like (38 + 19) - 3.
Let's test this:
1. Calculate 38 + 19, which equals 57.
2. Subtract 3 from 57, which equals 54.
Hence, the equation that satisfies the condition is: (38 + 19) - 3.
</think>
<answer>(38 + 19) - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 65 and 49 which are relatively large in value. They are close together and may need to be manipulated using addition or subtraction to get them closer to 14. Given that 49 is closer to 50, the first thought is to subtract 49 from 65, which simplifies the equation to 16 - 65.
However, 16 - 65 is not equal to 14. I'll consider adding the numbers 2 and 49 and then subtracting 65 to see if I can get closer to 14. Adding 2 and 49 gives us 51. Then subtracting 65, we get -14, so that doesn't work either.
Moving on, I'll consider if I can use the numbers by performing addition first. Adding 65 and 2 gives us 67. Unfortunately, there seems to be no easy operation to perform with this to reach 14 that involves only subtraction.
Finally, there's the option to multiply. If I multiply 2 and 49, I get 98. Adding 65 to 98 does not give me 14, so this isn't suitable either.
Given all these approaches, it seems like subtracting could help. If I subtract 49 from 65, I get 16. The only way to get to 14 from 16 using the last number (2) is to subtract 2 from 16. This gives me the equation: 65 - 49 - 2 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 49 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 95, 13, and 14 to work with, and we need to create an equation that equals 68. Initially, 95 seems too large to be used directly in subtraction or division without overshooting our target. However, we could subtract 13 or 14 from 95, and then use the result in a calculation that would bring us to 68 using the other numbers.
Let's try 95 - 13 first:
This gives us 82. Now we have 14 and we need to find a way to get 68 from these numbers.
Now, let's subtract 14 from 82:
This gives us 68. All the numbers have been used exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 13) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 59, 62, and 16 exactly once such that the final result is 13. Let's explore the different operations now.
First, division and multiplication could potentially be helpful as they would allow us to manipulate the numbers effectively. However, since we are looking for a single outcome of 13, I'll first think about division as it can reduce the magnitude of the numbers.
Let's try using division on 62 and 16. 
62 / 16 = 3.875
This result is not 13, but it's nearby. Now, I'll try subtracting the product of 59 and the result of the division from 13. 
59 * 3.875 = 229.625
Now, subtract this from 13:
13 - 229.625 = -216.625
This also doesn't yield the number 13. Going back to the numbers 59 and 62, if we sum their values:
59 + 62 = 121
Now, let's look at what happens if we use subtraction on these results:
121 - 13 = 108
This doesn't help either. 
What if we look at using 16 in a different way? If we subtract the divisor from the dividend (62 - 46) and then divide by 16, we get:
(62 - 16) / 16 = 46 / 16 = 2.875
Then let's subtract this from our sum of 121:
121 - 2.875 = 118.125
Still not our target. If we take 59 - 16, the result is:
59 - 16 = 43
Then if we divide our target result 13 by this final difference:
13 / (59 - 16) = 13 / 43 = 0.30234...
None of these steps have worked. To figure out the best route, I need to think about using 16 with another arithmetic operation.
16 itself could be used. If I multiply 16 by a number such that when subtracted from 59 that sum, divided by 62 minus a part of 16, we can arrive at 13. 
If I take 43 / 3 = 14.33, the closest integer solution, we would use 43/3 since 16 * 43/3 = 217.33, then:
(59 - 217.33) / 62 = -158.33/62 = -2.563...
However, this does not equal 13.
Playing with these operations more closely, I find:
16 * (59 - 43) / 62 = 16 * 16 / 62 = 256 / 62 ≈ 4.12 
This is not 13 either. 
In revisiting the possibility of division and manipulation:
59 / (62 - 16) = 59 / 46 = 1.28E2-1
I have gone in circles.
Let's assume I use 59 - 62 values:
(59 - 62) / 16 = -3 / 16 = -0.1875
I am close but not there.
(59 - 62 + 16) / 16 = 13 / 16 = 0.8125
Realizing this does not reach my target.
Finally, combining different numbers through steps:
16 + 59 - 62 = 13
This directly equals the number 13 using the combined arithmetic operation.</think>
<answer>(16 + 59 - 62)</answer>

==============
<think> The numbers provided are 92, 50, and 91. We need to generate an equation using these numbers exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that equals 51.
First, let's try combining 91 and 50 since they are close to 51. The difference between 91 and 50 is 41, which seems to be large to possibly reach 51 with 92. However, 91 - 41 = 50.
Next, let's subtract the difference from 92: 92 - 41 = 51.
So, the equation formed would be: 92 - (91 - 50) = 51.
</think>
<answer> 92 - (91 - 50) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 81, 71, and 62. I need to form an equation using each exactly once that equals 90. If I look at the target number, 90, it seems closer to lower numbers, so I might need to subtract or divide. Meanwhile, 81 is the largest number, so it might be good to subtract from it to get closer to 90.
Let's try with 81 - 71 = 10. While 10 is close to 90, we still need the other two numbers to make up 80. Now, I can take 62 and subtract it to reach 90: 81 - 71 - 62 + x = 90. But since we can't use the numbers more than once, we'll adjust this by manipulating our target operation. 
It seems removing 62 from 81 first and then finding another way with 71 and 62 isn't working well. Let's try to use multiplication or division within the steps.
81 * (71 / 62) is approximately 81 * 1. 141 (calculated in mind), which is closer to 90, but the answer is approximately 89, still not exact. However, if we use 81 * (71 / 62) - y = 90, and y = 81 * 1. 141 - 90 = 0. 141, the application of 0. 141 isn't an integer, so this isn't viable.
Lastly, let's try: 81 - 62 + 71 = 90, which satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 62 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we are working with - 65, 25, and 78. We need to create an expression that gives us 12.
- One approach could be to use the subtraction operation to adjust one of the values to get closer to 12.
- By considering 78 and 25 first, subtracting 25 from 78 gives us 53.
- Now, we need to use 65, and if we subtract 53 from 65 we will have 12.
- Thus, our equation will be: 65 - 53 = 12.
 </think>
<answer> 65 - (78 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 29, and 37. We need an equation that uses these numbers in such a way that the final result equals 77. Observing the numbers, we see that 69 and 29 can be manipulated to get closer to 77.
If we use 69 - 29 = 40, we want to then get 37 closer to the final result of 77. This suggests we could use 40 + 37 = 77. However, we must use the numbers 69, 29 and 37 each exactly once.
Now, let's see if we can build on 69 and 29 directly. One possibility is 69 - 29 = 40, and then find a way to add 37 to reach 77 using the remaining number. We could then add 37 to 40, which indeed gives us 77.
So, the equation using the numbers provided would be: 69 - 29 + 37 = 77.
</think>
<answer>69 - 29 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> I start with the given numbers [69, 29, 37]. I need to combine them using basic arithmetic to reach 77. The number 69 seems the most complex to work with, and 29 and 37 can be potentially combined in various ways to help reach 77.
Let's consider if we can combine 37 and 29 in some way. If we add them, we get: 37 + 29 = 66. Now, we need 11 more to reach 77. If we take 69 - 11, we get 58, which isn't close to what we need.
Instead, let's try multiplying 37 and 29: 37 * 29 = 1073, which is far from 77. That seems unlikely.
Multiplying 69 by either 29 or 37 alone is also not feasible. Given that 69 is significantly larger than 77 and 29 and 37 are not big enough to produce 77, the options to apply operations directly on 69 itself seems the most promising.
Let's re-evaluate with the operations:
If we consider 69 - 29 = 40, then adding 37 to it: 40 + 37 = 77. This gives us a result of 77 successfully! </think>
<answer> 69 - 29 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the number 93 using the numbers 92, 1, 14, 14. Given that 92 is very close to 93, I'll subtract 14 from 92 first. This will give me 78. Next, to get from 78 to 93, I need to add 15. I can form 15 using 14 and 1 by adding these numbers together. So, my equation becomes (92 - 14 + 14). 
Now I'll construct my final equation: (92 - 14) + 14 = 78, then I need to add 15 more to reach 93. So, the final equation to be constructed is (92 - 14) + 14 + 1 = 93. 
Therefore, the equation should be (92 - 14) + 14 + 1.
</think>
<answer>(92 - 14) + 14 + 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I will evaluate the options given the constraints. We have the numbers 3, 16, and 81. The target is 43. Let's first consider multiplication and division, as they can potentially bring us closer to 43 or reduce the disparity between the target and the sum/difference.

Considering division, using 16 or 81 could be useful. If we divide 16 by 4, we get 4, which is close to but not quite 39 (43 - 4 = 39).

Secondly, let's try combinations with the number 3. If we use 81 / 3, we get 27. Now, if we operate on 27 with the remaining number, 16, we can reach 43 with a simple equation: 27 + 16. This succeeds in reaching 43.
</think>
<answer> (81 / 3) + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations that could be useful in making the numbers 32, 70, and 34 combine to give 68. Since these numbers are large and 68 is close to 70, using addition or subtraction might be tricky, so I'll focus on multiplication and division.
Considering some basic divisions, we find that:
70 / 34 is approximately 2.06, which isn't helpful.
But 70 / 32 could be close to 2.19, which resembles 2.25. This seems promising.
So, let's calculate 70 / 32, we get approximately 2.19.
Now we have 2.19 and 34, and we need to get 68.
2.19 * 34 gives approximately 74, which is close to 68.
Therefore, we now need to reduce it by 6, and we can use the number 32.
32 - 6 = 26, but that's too little. 
Let me now try a new combination, adding 34 with 32 should give me 66.
Then, to get 68, I could subtract 2. But 2 is not one of the numbers I have.
A different approach, combining all three: 70 - 34 gives 36, then adding 32 to it gives 68.
So, 70 - 34 + 32 equals 68.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 34 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 16, 91, 49, and 43 exactly once. 
One strategy is to look at subtraction first because 91 - 43 will give us 48, which is close to 81. 
Now we need to achieve the difference of 19 between 91 - 43 = 48 and 81. We can try adding 49 to 48 to make 97 and then subtracting 16 to get 81.
So, the strategy is: (91 - 43 + 49) - 16 = 81. </think>
<answer>(91 - 43 + 49) - 16</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 32, 33, and 41 only once. 
I see that 41 is close to 40, so 41 - 1 will give me 40. 
However, I need a '1' and 41 is not a single number. 
Next, I notice that 41 + 32 = 73 and 73 - 33 = 40. 
So, I'm getting closer, but I need 33 to be -3 instead of +32.
If I invert the whole operation, then -33 + 73 = 40. 
Thus, the equation will be taking the negative of 33 from 41 + 32.
</think>
<answer> (41 + 32) - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 35, 50, and 56 once each and combine them to make 29. 
I'll start by considering subtractions. Subtracting 35 from 50 can give 15. This is close to 29, but we need 29, not 15.
Next, seeing if I can subtract the larger remaining number to get closer to 29 might be helpful. 
56 - 35 is 21. Now we have to find a way to get from 21 to 29 more easily.
Since 29 - 21 = 8, and 8 can be produced by 50 - 32 (which isn't directly possible with the given numbers), I'll check to see if 32 is achievable by combining the numbers. 
I notice that 56 - 35 = 21. Now 21 - 35 is not equal to 8, so I'll try another combination.
56 - 50 = 6. Adding 6 to 35 does not get me the 8 I need.
After testing, I see 56 - 35 = 21, and 50 - 21 = 29, but I can only use each number once.
I'll take 56 - 50 = 6, then I can use that 6 with 35 to make 41, which doesn't help, and I'm not close to 29.
Instead, I'll consider 50 - (35 - x) and need x to be 4. But 4 is not an option here.
I'll then test possibilities that work with the current known equations:
35 + 50 - 56 = 35 + (50 - 56) = 35 - 6 = 29.
So, 35 + 50 - 56 equals 29.
</think>
<answer>35 + 50 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target number - 99. Next, I'll examine the numbers: 36, 26, and 89. Clearly, 89 is the largest and 26 is the smallest. Subtracting 26 from 89 gives us 63, which is closer to 99 than we started with. Now, the difference between 99 and 63 is 36. Therefore, we can express 99 as 89 - 26 + 36. This satisfies the equality and each number is used exactly once. </think>
<answer> 89 - 26 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll list out a few basic operations to start with: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Given that division produces fractional results and multiplication mostly just scales numbers, let's try subtraction and addition. 
I see that 58 is the highest number and is relatively far from 64. This suggests a subtraction operation might be key. Maybe the difference from 58 to 64 could help. 
58 - 19 = 39
This gives us 39 which is close but still not 64. It's natural that we might look for a way to add to this result. 
Next, I notice that 12 + 13 = 25 which is below 64. I see that if I add 25 to 39, I can reach 64. 
So, the equation involves:
(58 - 19) + 12 + 13 = 64
</think>
<answer>(58 - 19) + 12 + 13</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination that can generate 94 using the numbers 76, 44, and 62 with basic arithmetic. I notice that 94 is close to 96, which is 2 more than 94. Since 44 is the smallest number, I might be able to subtract it from 76 to make the gap smaller. 
The equation would be: 76 - 44 + 62 which simplifies to 32 + 62. Now, 32 + 62 equals 94.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 44) + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by considering the target number: 25. The numbers I have are 49, 34, 19, and 59. 25 is close to 19, which suggests subtraction could be involved. Let's see if subtracting 19 from 34 gives us 15. Indeed, 34 - 19 = 15. Now I need 15 more to get to 25. 15 is exactly 59 - 49. Therefore, the equation that works for me is 34 - 19 + 59 - 49 = 25. </think>
<answer> (34 - 19) + 59 - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 79, 45, and 20. We need to create an equation that equals 14. 
We need to use each of these numbers exactly once, and the only allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Considering 20 is a large number, it's likely that we'll need to use division or some other operation to get it closer to 14.
We could try to get 14 using 45 and 20. For instance, we can think of 45 ÷ 20, which doesn't equal 14, but could give us a fraction that helps.
Let's see if we can arrange 79 in such a way that the equation equals 14. We should check if we can add, subtract, or multiply other numbers to reach 14.
If we take 45 and 20, their subtraction (45 - 20) gives us 25, which doesn't help. However, 45 - 20 = 25 and then 79 - 25 = 54, which, if divided by 3, equals 18. That's still too far from 14.
Now, considering 79, we don't have numbers of simpler subtraction that could help. So, maybe we should explore 79 with 45.
If we take 79 - 45 = 34, and then think of multiplying by 20 and using 14. Since we've already used 25 with 45-20, then considering 34, dividing it by 2 would give 17. And, if we divide 34 by 2, we get 17.
This seems way too large for 14. Then, let's consider that we could use division: 79 - 45 = 34, and then 34 / 2 = 17. This doesn't fit our goal, but it's the closest we have so far.
Considering that 25 - 7 = 18 with 45 - 20, we should check 79 and adjust accordingly. As we cannot include subtraction on fractions or decimals, we should look at 79 and see if we can form a smaller number. We could think of 79 - 45 + 20, which equals 54, and then further division. But 25 - 7 isn't possible using 20 alone to reach 14.
Let's reframe it using simple operations. Since 45 - 20 = 25, dividing 25 by 2 gets us 12.5, not 14. So we must have another approach.
We can think that, since 79 - 45 = 34, 34 - 20 = 14, and that uses all numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 45) - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers provided: 60, 15, and 47. 
Looking at these, we can observe that 60 - 15 = 45, which is close to 28 but a bit too high.
Next, I see that 60 - 47 = 13.
Considering 15 can only be used once, I can think of a formula involving 13 and 15.
If I add 13 and 15 I get 28.
Therefore, the equation can be 15 + (60 - 47) = 28.
</think>
<answer>15 + (60 - 47)</answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I need to evaluate the given numbers 32, 6, 63 to get 89. Adding 32 and 63 gives 95, which seems close to 89. Subtracting 6 from 95 gives 89, which is the target number. Now, the operation of adding 32 and 63 is straightforward. We just need to combine these into a single equation using the available numbers. I can write it as: 32 + 63 - 6. </think>
<answer>32 + 63 - 6</answer>

==============
<think> I need to achieve the result of 77 using the numbers 19, 92, 9, and 5 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. Starting with the larger numbers, 92 seems promising. Subtracting 9 from 92 gives us 83. Now, 77 is closer to 83 rather than 9, so we make a slight adjustment by subtracting 6 instead of 9. So we subtract 5 from 92 to get 87, and then subtract 10 to get 77. The number 10 can be obtained by subtracting 19 from 9. This gives us the equation: 92 - 5 - (19 - 9).
</think>
<answer> 92 - 5 - (19 - 9) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers [20, 18, 75] up to one time each, let's consider the operations we have.
The target number is 73.
Starting with 75 would mean subtracting 2 (75 - 2 = 73).
However, our only other number is 20, which we need to work with to reach 73.
18 - 20 = -2, which is too negative.
Multiplying 75 with 18 or 20 won't give us the result of 73.
Now, let's try a combination with 20. If we add 20 to 18, we get 38. To reach 73 from 75, we need to further reduce 38 from 75.
75 - 38 = 37, but we need 73, so this isn't the answer.
Considering division operations, 75 / 18 or 75 / 20 won't get us 73.
Adding 75 and 20 doesn't help (75 + 20 = 95, not 73).
Finally, subtracting: 75 - 20 = 55. To get to 73 from 55, we need to reduce 55 by 22, which isn't an immediate possibility.
Considering the nature of the problem, it appears that the sought equation is a combination involving the subtraction of 20 from 75 and then adding something that equals 73 when added to 55.
75 - 20 = 55. To reach 73, we need to add 18 (because 55 + 18 = 73).
So the equation is: 75 - 20 + 18 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 20 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers given: 93, 85, and 76. We need to find a way to use each of these numbers only once to get a result of 84. 
Since we are working with a target of 84 and the numbers we have are relatively close to 84, a possible way is to start by adjusting the numbers by subtraction and possibly division.
If I look at 93 and 76, I realize 93 - 76 equals 17. This isn't immediately helpful towards our goal of reaching 84.
Moving on to the next possible operations, we can look at the subtraction between 85 and 76 which gives us 9.
Now, instead of using the original numbers directly, let's think if combining them in a different way might work. 
If I take 85 - 17, which is the result of 93 - 76, and then add 76, the equation becomes (85 - (93 - 76)) + 76. 
Let's evaluate this step-by-step:
(85 - 17) + 76 = 85 - 17 + 76 = 68 + 76 = 144.
Clearly, this doesn't give us 84. 
Since operations on 17 didn't work out and adding or subtracting 76 didn't help, let's explore what happens if we rearrange the order and operations. 
Considering 93 - 85 = 8, 8 + 76 = 84. 
Rearranging the numbers and using operations in this way does give us our target.
So, the correct equation is (93 - 85) + 76 = 84.
</think>
<answer>(93 - 85) + 76</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get to 94 using the numbers 36, 39, and 97. These numbers don't make it easy to reach 94 directly, so I should think of a combination of operations that could help.
Considering the numbers available, multiplication and division seem promising as they can potentially alter the value in a useful way.
I observe that 97 is the largest number, which might be operated upon to make the other two numbers significant.
I can take 97 and subtract 39, which leaves me with 58 (97 - 39 = 58).
Next, I need to get from 58 to 94. The difference between 94 and 58 is 36 (94 - 58 = 36).
So I realize that 36 can be achieved by adding 36 (36 + 0 = 36). However, 0 is not available, so I need to think of another way.
I take 58, subtract 39 (leaving me with 58 - 39 = 19). Then, I can add 36 to 19 (19 + 36 = 55) to get 94 (since 19 + 36 = 55 and 94 - 55 = 39 which equals 39).
So, combining all these steps together, I get:
97 - 39 + 36 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 39 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 48, 47, and 41, and equals 40. I can approach this by first looking for number combinations that can be subtracted or added to approach 40.
Considering the numbers, if I subtract smaller numbers from larger ones, I might reach a target around 40. Noting that 47 is quite close to 40, I can attempt 47 - some number, where the number subtracted is picked from the other two numbers, 48 and 41.
- If I subtract 41 from 47, I get 6.
- If I then subtract 6 from 48, I get 42.
- Unfortunately, 42 is too high.
Instead, I should think about combining two of the numbers and then subtracting another.
If I subtract 48 - 41 from 47, I get:
47 - (48 - 41)
That simplifies to:
47 - 7
And this equals:
40
Therefore, the equation that uses 48, 47, and 41 to get 40 is 47 - (48 - 41).
</think>
<answer>47 - (48 - 41)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation that equals 44 using the numbers 63, 58, 6, and 71. Given that 63 and 71 are quite far from 44, let's try to use their differences or other numbers in a way that can be manipulated to reach 44.
Considering 71 and 63 differ by 9, and 58 is close to 44, I'll try to use these numbers to lean towards 44.
71 - 58 = 13
Now I need to reach 31 from 6. I can use division: 6 / 2 = 3, but to reach 31, I need a larger multiple. Using 6 / 6 gives me just 1, so this doesn't work.
Next, I recall the difference of 9 from 71, can be divided by 3 to reach 31: (71 - 58) / 3 = 3, which brings me closer but not quite there.
Using 63 - 71 + 58 - 6, I get:
63 - 71 = -8,
-8 + 58 = 50,
50 - 6 = 44.
Therefore, the equation that equals 44 with the given numbers is:
(63 - 71 + 58 - 6) = 44.
</think>
<answer>(63 - 71 + 58 - 6)</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 17, 80, and 38 that equals 59, I'll first try to manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
Starting with basic additions and subtractions:
17 + 80 = 97, which is far from 59.
Now, let's try operations involving subtracting 38:
97 - 38 = 59 is our target number, but we haven't used any of the numbers 17 or 80 yet.
Since 97 can be made from 80 + 17, I'll try combining these:
80 + 17 - 38 = 59
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and performs the operations to get the result of 59.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 17 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 97 using the numbers 39, 17, and 41. 
I'll start with calculating some possibilities:
- Adding 39 and 41 gives 80.
- If I add 17 to 80, I get 97 exactly. So, the equation becomes:
39 + 41 + 17 = 97.
Now I have used all the numbers only once and the equation holds true.
</think>
<answer>39 + 41 + 17</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if the numbers could be combined in a straightforward way to reach 78. The number 78 is not a sum of the given numbers, and 78 is not directly obtainable from 53 or 25 through multiplication or division. However, we can use the number 50 in the equation.
Next, I need to figure out what to do with the numbers 53 and 25. Observing that 53 - 25 = 28, which is close to 78 but not quite there. If we add 50, we get 28 + 50 = 78, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is (53 - 25) + 50 = 78.
</think>
<answer>(53 - 25) + 50</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers: 14, 65, and 43. We need to create an equation that results in 36, using each number only once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can consider using subtraction and division:
65 - 43 = 22
Now we need 14 to be used along with 22 to reach 36.
14 + 22 = 36
This satisfies all the conditions - we used each number, only basic arithmetic operations, and got the result we needed.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 43) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 61, 96, and 55 once each to get a total of 90. The most feasible approach would be to combine the numbers in a way they can be subtracted, added, or divided to reach 90.
Firstly, 96 - 61 = 35. This gives me 35 from the numbers provided.
Now, I have 35 and 55 left. Subtracting 55 from 35 will not get me closer to 90, so I need to think of another combination.
35 + 55 = 90. This gives me the target result, but I haven't used the subtraction of 61 and 96 in the process. 
Given that 61 - 55 = 6, I can approach the final combining: 90 - 6 = 84 is not valid since I need to keep 61 and 55 intact.
Instead, I realize I can combine the number by using 96 - (61 - 55) = 96 - 6 = 90. This gives me the 90 target with the use of all provided numbers once.
</think>
<answer> 96 - (61 - 55) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 96, 18, and 52 exactly once to produce the number 62. I should consider combining these numbers using arithmetic operations.
First, I notice that 96 - 52 = 44. This is a significant step.
Now I need to find a way to get from 44 to 62. Adding 18 to 44 won't work because that's 62, but we can't repeat numbers. Using subtraction or multiplication won't help either because 44 - 18 = 26 and 44 * 18 = 798, neither of which equal 62.
Then I realize that I need to subtract smaller numbers from 44 to reach 62. 44 - 18 = 26, if I subtract another 16, I would reach 62.
So I take 52 - 18 = 34, and then 96 - 34 = 62.
Thus, the equation is 96 - (52 - 18) = 62. </think>
<answer> 96 - (52 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations we can perform with the given numbers: 88, 65, and 89. We need to create an equation that results in 66. 
Looking at the numbers, it appears that a combination of subtraction or addition might be needed since the result 66 is close to one of the numbers and not extremely far.
- If we use subtraction, we could get close to 65-9 = 56 and then maybe 56+10 = 66.
- However, 9 is not one of the numbers.
- If we use addition, we could try to add and subtract numbers in a way that leads to 66.
- Let's try (89 + 65 - 88). 
  First, 89 + 65 = 154,
  Then, 154 - 88 = 66.
This satisfies the requirement using all numbers only once.
</think>
<answer>(89 + 65 - 88)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 83, and 20 that equals 94. 
- First, considering 83 is relatively large and 20 is relatively small, using multiplication or division would likely lead to a result outside the range of 94 with these numbers.
- Adding 20 to 83 gives us 103, which is too much, so that won't work.
- Subtracting 20 or 83 from 94 is not achievable with just these numbers.
- Using 9, we can see if combining it in various arithmetic operations can help.
- I notice that 94 - 20 = 74. So, if we could get 74 from 83 and 9, that would work.
- Now, 83 - 9 equals 74, and we already have 20.
- Therefore, the equation using 83 - 9 + 20 = 94.
</think>
<answer>(83 - 9) + 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the options and the target number. The target is 87, and the numbers we have are 85, 63, and 65. 
87 - 85 = 2, and 2 isn't enough to get us there using the other numbers.
63 - 65 = -2, which is not helpful either.
Let's consider other operations with the numbers.
65 - 63 = 2, which, if multiplied by something, might help, but no single number seems to fit.
65 + 63 = 128, which is too large.
Now, let's try 85 and 63:
85 + 63 = 148.
This is also not right.
But let's try another approach. Let's think about combining 85 and 63 in a different way.
85 - 63 = 22. If we then subtract 22 from 87 (our target), we get:
87 - 22 = 65.
So, we need to form 22 from 85 and 63. 
85 - 63 = 22.
Then we subtract this from 87:
87 - 22 = 65.
However, 65 isn't the correct target number. We need 87.
What if we reverse the order?
63 - 65 = -2, and multiply it by 43 (since 85 - 43 = 42 and 43 is needed to get 22).
(85 - 65) * 43 = 20 * 43 = 860, which is too large.
85 - 63 = 12. This is too large. 
Another approach would be:
87 - 65 - 63 = -41, which is not helpful.
I'll try adding smaller numbers:
(85 - 65) + 63 = 22
Then 87 - 22 = 65, which is incorrect.
Finally, we could try this:
85 - (63 - 65) = 85 - -2 = 87.
So, the equation is formed as:
85 - (63 - 65) = 87.
</think>
<answer> 85 - (63 - 65) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and how I can manipulate them to reach 87. The numbers are 85, 63, and 65. 
87 is close to both 85 and 65, which are both integers as well.
Given that we can use each number only once, I should start by considering if borrowing or adding 2 to 63 can help. 
By adding 2 to 63, we get 65, which is already one of our numbers. 
Now we're looking at 85 and 65 to solve for 87.
To get 87 from 85, I need to add 2. Since 65 is already present, I need to find out how to get 2 from 85 and 63.
85 - 63 = 22, which is far from our requirement, so it doesn't work that way.
I then consider a combination of multiplying 63 by a fraction that makes sense. If I take 1/3 of 63, I get 21, which could be subtracted from 85 to get 64, but we still need to reach 87.
Another approach could be combining 63 and 65. Their sum (128) is too large.
Looking at 85 - 65 = 20, which is close, but we still need 7 left to get to 87. 
If I use a negative operation, I can subtract 63 from 65 to get 2, and then add 85 to that: 
65 - 63 = 2
85 + 2 = 87
This way, I use all the numbers exactly once, and the equation checks out.
</think>
<answer> 85 + (65 - 63) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 37, 34, and 25 to equal 75. First, I'll consider using multiplication and addition/subtraction because these operations can combine the numbers effectively to reach 75. Looking at the numbers, multiplying 25 by 3 seems promising because that would give me 75, and 3 needs to be expressed using the other numbers.
If we take 34 - 21 = 13, then 13 + 25 = 38, and this doesn't help in getting 75 directly. However, now we have 13, and if we use 37 - 13, we get 24. Now, let's see if 24 + 38 equals 72, which is close but not quite there. The slight difference can be made up by using 13 directly.
From 34 - 21 = 13, if I combine this with 37, I would get 50. This still isn’t 75, but if I add 25 to 50, I get 75, which is our target.
So, the equation works out to be (34 - 21) + 37 + 25 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (34 - 21) + 37 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to think of a combination that can give me a result of 71 using the numbers 73, 48, and 46. Let's start by looking at what we can subtract from 73 to get close to 71. Subtracting 46 from 73 gives me 27, which is not 71. Now, let's consider dividing 73 by something. If I divide 73 by 48, I get approximately 1. 52, which isn't helpful.
Let's consider multiplying and dividing. Multiplying 48 and 46 gives 2208, which is far from 71. Dividing 73 by 46 gives approximately 1. 59, which seems close to a fractional answer.
Now let's try combining all these ideas. If I take 73, subtract 46, and then add 48, I am looking for the following equation: 73 - 46 + 48. Let's calculate it:
73 - 46 + 48 = 27 + 48 = 75,
This is slightly more than 71.
Let's try subtracting 48 from 73 instead and then adding 46: 73 - 48 + 46. Let's calculate it:
73 - 48 + 46 = 25 + 46 = 71.
We have found our solution.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 48 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 49, 82, and 19 to reach the number 52. Let's start by considering the numbers. We have four options for operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
One of the numbers might be the result of one of these operations on the other two numbers. Let's try the division first, as it could potentially bring us closer to the target:
49 / 19 = 2.5736 (approx).
This result is close but not 52. Next, if we consider 82 / 19, we get:
82 / 19 = 4.3158 (approx).
Again, this isn't close to 52. Let's try combining operations, using addition and subtraction:
(82 - 49) + 19.
Here we have 82 - 49 = 33, and then adding 19 gives us:
33 + 19 = 52. 
This results exactly in 52, which is our target.
</think>
<answer>(82 - 49) + 19</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the value of 82 using the numbers 6, 5, and 81. Given that 81 is close to 82, it seems likely that subtraction or addition of 1 will help. However, 6 is too small to be the difference between 6 and 82, and we can't use it again. Hence, we could try subtracting 5 from 81 and then adding 6. Let's calculate that: 81 - 5 + 6 = 81 - 5 = 76, and then 76 + 6 = 82. This works out. 
</think>
<answer> (81 - 5) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, note that 87 is quite close to 89, which is 2 more than our target number 87. This suggests we may need to add 2 to our equation to get 87. Looking at our numbers, 26 and 2 are numbers that could help achieve this. We need to add 2: 26 + 2 = 28. Now our equation is 28 + ? = 87 or, 28 + ? = 87 which needs an addition of 59 to be 87.
Considering that we can only use each number once, let's try to link 26 and 2 with 59 in some operation. To get 26 from 59 and 2, we can subtract 59 - 26 = 33, but this doesn't give us a way to include 2 again. However, 59 and 2 can be used with multiplication or division.
If we divide 59 by 2, we get 29.5, which is not an integer and we need an integer result and it's also not equal to 87.
Next, we look at subtraction: 59 - (26 - 2). If we perform this, we get 59 - 24 = 35.
Therefore, we can form the following equation: 26 + 2 + (59 - 26) = 87.
Let's simplify it: 26 + 2 + 33 = 87.
Since 26 + 2 = 28 and 28 + 59 - 26 = 87, it doesn't work. This means the only viable way to use 59, 26, and 2 to get to 87 involves multiplication and subtraction.
So, 59 * 1. 5 - 26 + 2 = 87. But we don't have 1. 5. Instead, let's think of combining operations to fit 2 numbers.
The final form we are looking for seems to involve these numbers: 59 - 26 + 2 * some number. We need to find the correct value for the multiplication to result in 87. 
2 * 35 = 70, closer but not quite there. We need a number close to 13.5. So, 2 * 35 and 59 - 26 = 33. 33 + 70 = 103. This is still not working.
We realize the structure we need is using the numbers 59, 26, 2 in a way that they can add up to 87 through operations. Let's try addition in reverse or subtraction first and multiplication:
59 + 26 + 2 * 1 = 87. But 2 * 1 results in 2, not 59. Thus the structure we are looking for is:
59, 26 + 2. Let's utilize the fact that 59 + 26 = 85, so adding 2 to get 87.
So, the equation is (59 + 26) + 2 = 87. Simplified this leads to 87 = 87.
</think>
<answer>(59 + 26) + 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 57, 36, and 91 that equals 70, using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with 57 and 36, I notice that 57 - 36 = 21.
Adding or subtracting 91 from these doesn't seem to get me closer to 70. 
Then, I see that if I use division, it might work. 
91 / 3. 67 ≈ 25 (not close to 70); it seems too difficult to get a nice integer solution this way.
Lastly, trying subtraction first with 91 - 57 and then adding 36:
91 - 57 = 34
34 + 36 = 70
Here I successfully used each number once and utilized subtraction and addition to reach 70.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 57 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if there's a combination that can yield 91 using the given numbers 17, 9, and 99. Subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones or adding in a way to approach 91 seems likely.
Let's try: 99 - 17 + 9
99 - 17 = 82
Now add 9 to 82: 82 + 9 = 91
So the equation is 99 - 17 + 9 = 91.</think>
<answer>99 - 17 + 9</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers available: 4, 38, and 78. I need to create an equation that equals 36 using basic arithmetic operations while ensuring each number is used only once.
One possible way to explore this is to use subtraction and division. Let's see if I can find a way to utilize 78 and 38 to reduce the number enough to reach 36 when combined with 4.
If I take 78 - 40 and then combine it with 38, I get 38 - 40 + 78, which simplifies to -2 + 78 = 76. This is too high. 
Instead, I'll try subtracting 38 from 78 and then finding how 4 can be incorporated. If I do 78 - 38 = 40, and then subtract 40 - 4 = 36.
So, the equation is: 78 - 38 - 4 = 36.
</think>
<answer>78 - 38 - 4</answer>

==============
<think> To get 36 with the numbers 4, 38, and 78, we need to think creatively about the operations we can use.
First, let's consider the numbers. 78 is the largest, and 38 is significantly larger than 4. This suggests we might look to manipulate these numbers using operations to create the target number 36.
Given 78 and 38, the difference between them is 40. If we can make use of 40 by subtracting 4, we can potentially move closer to 36.
So, let's see where we might have 4 or 38 left for subtraction. The number 38 itself might be ideal for subtraction from 40. If we subtract 4 from 38, we get 34. Now we have:
78 - 38 - 4 = 36
This equation uses 4, 38, and 78 only once each and correctly evaluates to 36. </think>
<answer> 78 - 38 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the given numbers 96, 38, and 40. I need to figure out how to use these numbers once each to create an equation that evaluates to 18. 
I notice that 96 - 38 = 58, which is a useful intermediate value.
Then, 58 - 40 = 18. This gives us the final value we need.
Thus, the equation is 96 - 38 - 40 = 18.
</think>
<answer> (96 - 38) - 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 92, 52, and 39. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once that equals 79.
- The subtraction route seems promising since it can yield a large difference or a smaller number.
- 92 - 52 = 40, which is close to 79, giving us a difference of 39.
- We also have the number 39, which is exactly what's needed to complete the equation.
Thus, the equation would be 92 - 52 + 39 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 52) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the options to get to 48 using the numbers 89, 11, and 52. We can start by subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones to see if we can get closer to 48.
If we subtract 52 from 89, we get: 89 - 52 = 37.
Now we need 11 more to reach 48. However, 11 was not subtracted in the previous step, so it's not enough to get us there.
Let's see if we can get 11 by using division or addition with the 11 and 52. Dividing 52 by 4 does give us 13, but that doesn't work because 37 + 13 = 50, and we're still short of 48.
Now, let's add 11 to 37: 37 + 11 = 48.
So, the equation that uses the numbers 89, 11, 52 and results in 48 is 89 - 52 + 11.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 52 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 56, 31, and 5 that equals 30. I'll start by considering what kind of operations could make this happen. Let's explore multiplying and adding or subtracting.
The number 56 is significantly larger, and dividing it by any of the other numbers won't get us close to 30. On the other hand, 31 is not far off from 30, and multiplying or adding/subtracting 5 will be more likely to get us to 30.
Let's look at: 31 - 5 = 26. This is close to 30, and now we need 4 more to reach 30. We don't have another big enough number to make 4. Let's try 56 - 31 = 25, and then see if we can get 5 from that. 
If we have 56 - 31 = 25, and we're still missing 5, we could try 25 + 5 = 30. This works out perfectly. So combining all these parts, we get:
(56 - 31) + 5 </think>
<answer>(56 - 31) + 5</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 75 using the given numbers 53, 15, and 37. One approach is to use the largest number, 53, as the base and try to reach 22. Since 15 + 37 = 52 and 53 - 15 = 38, we can use subtraction. Then, to get from 38 to 22, we can subtract 16. Looking back at the numbers, we see 53 - 37 = 16. Therefore, the equation should be 53 - (37 - 15) which equals 53 - 22 = 31. This is not quite 75, so I should reconsider. Another way to approach it could be to use multiplication and addition. Since 15 * 5 = 75, and 53 - 15 is 38, it feels like the best path to build up to 75. In that case, 53 - 15 = 38, and I need an additional 37 to reach 75, which can be achieved by adding 37 to this 38. Therefore, the final equation should be 53 - 15 + 37.
</think>
<answer>53 - 15 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll analyze the given numbers: 3, 50, 16, 94. 
- 50 and 94 don't seem likely to combine effectively to reach 31.
- Multiplying 3 by any of them will not give us 31, and dividing any of them by 3 won't yield an integer.
- Adding and subtracting can be tried by pairing 3 and 94, as 94 - 3 = 91 and 91 - 50 = 41.
- Then, if we add 16, we have 41 + 16 = 57, which is too large.
- But if we take 50 and 16, we could see if these two can be manipulated further.
- We can observe that 50 - 16 = 34. Now if we take 34 - 94, we would get -60, which doesn't help.
- But considering 34 - 50 = -6, again not helpful.
- Next, consider 50 - 34 (which is 16). This is essentially the same as before and points us to previous manipulations.
- Finally, combining 16 with 3 in a different way, let's calculate 94 - (50 - 16). 
  - 94 - 34 = 94 - (50 - 16) = 94 - 50 + 16 = 44 + 16 = 60, which exceeds 31.
- Let's simplify further by trying again with 94 - 50 + 16 = 50 - 50 + 94 = 44 + 16 = 60.
- We need to reach 31, and the current manipulations aren't working.
- We can consider the simpler pairing: 94 - (50 - 16) = 94 - 34 = 60.
- Instead, we should focus on: 94 - 50 + 16 - 3 = 94 - 50 + (16 - 3) = 44 + 13 = 57.
- We haven't reached 31 yet.
- Instead, we should try: 94 - 50 + (3 - 16) = 94 - 50 + (-13) = 44 - 13 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 50 + (3 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add and subtract the numbers in various combinations to see if we can get close to 71. One useful approach is to look for a way to use the higher numbers first to maximize the result.
Considering the numbers 43, 1, and 29:
- If we add 43 and 29, we get 72, which is very close to 71.
- However, we can't add 1 to 72 to get 71.
- Now, let's see if we can subtract 1 from 72 to get 71. This works out well since subtracting 1 from 72 equals 71.

So, the equation is 43 + 29 - 1 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 29 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 18, and 2 that equals 41. Let's consider the nature of the numbers. 57 is significantly larger than 41, so subtraction or direct division by 57 is not a viable approach. The number 18 is useful as it can be subtracted or multiplied, and 2 could be helpful as well. Let's try subtracting some of these numbers from 57.
57 - 18 = 39. This is closer but still not 41. Now, subtracting 2 from 39 is 37, which is not the target. Adding 2 to 39 is 41, which is exactly what we need. Thus, 
(57 - 18) + 2 = 41.
</think>
<answer>(57 - 18) + 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 57, 18, and 2 that when operated on will give me 41. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 57 is quite large and could possibly be manipulated through subtraction. 18 and 2 could be useful in achieving the target number 41.
1. Let's consider 57 - 18 which equals 39. We are close, but not quite there.
2. Next, I think of adding 2 to 39 to reach 41. So, 57 - 18 + 2 = 41.
3. All of the numbers 57, 18, and 2 are used exactly once and the equation equals 41. </think>
<answer> (57 - 18) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 68, 28, 43, and 41 that equals 38. 
First, considering the numbers given, 68 is quite larger and 41 is significantly smaller than 38, so these numbers are unlikely to be directly used in the arithmetic without going into complex operations.
28 and 43 are closer to 38, and they suggest subtraction could be useful, as in 28 - 43 = -15. This result is too far from 38. 
I see 41 is close to 38, and 68 is the only remaining number. If I subtract 41 from 68, I get 27.
Now, to reach from 27 to 38, I need to adjust it slightly. Luckily, 27 + 11 = 38. Now I need to find 11 using the numbers 28 and 43.
Considering 28 - 43 = -15, we went wrong with that approach. I need to find a way to rearrange. 28 - 43 is negative, so using 68 will reverse the sign, aiming for 43 - 28 = 15, which is close to 11.
Therefore, (68 - 43) - (28 - 41) = 25 - 11 = 14, which got me a bit off. However, I look for 11 further in my options. 
If I directly subtract 28 from 43, I get 15, which is almost right. Then I need to adjust this to get to 11. Adjusting by subtracting 4 from 15 results in 11. Therefore, I have 43 - 28 - (43 - 28) = 15 - 4 = 11.
Combining now, we get (68 - (43 - 28)) = 68 - (15) = 53 which is too large, so I need to check the initial assumptions. 
Revisiting, the correct steps are: ((68 - 43) - (28 - 41)) = 25 - 4 = 21, which is still off.
Correcting again logically, I get: (43 - (28 - (68 - 41)) = 43 - (28 - 27) = 43 - 1 = 42 which is too big.
Finally, I get it:  (68 - 28) - (43 - 41) = 40 - 2 = 38.
</think>
<answer>(68 - 28) - (43 - 41)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's break down the numbers we have: 64, 48, and 14. We need to use these in a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 30.
We can check possible combinations:
- If we try 64 - 48 = 16, we need a further operation to reach 30. 16 + 14 also doesn't work.
- If we consider multiplying and dividing, 64 / 14 doesn't yield a reasonable result.
- Let's try 64 - 48 = 16, and then apply the remaining 14. Do we have an operation to get 14? We could use 14 - 14, but that makes the result 0.
- Then, we can try this: 64 - (48 / 14). This would be 64 - 3.42857... which is not close to 30.
- We should also consider if we can subtract 64 from 48 and then do something with the result. For example: 48 - 64 * (14 / 10) = -15.6, which is far from our target.
- Considering 64 / 14 is not an exact answer and 48 / 14 isn't simple, let's think of another possibility: 64 / (14 - 48) or rearranged, (64 / (48 - 14))
- Checking the arithmetic: First, 48 - 14 equals 34, so we have: 64 / 34 = 1.882352941...
- Realizing this is still not close to 30, let's re-evaluate combining all possibilities. Perhaps, we can isolate 48 / 14 to get a whole number first, then possibly adjust.
- 48 / 14 = 3.42857... and 64 - 3 = 61, which is too high.
- Trying 64 / (48 - 14) = 64 / 34 = 1.882352941... This is not correct, the closest possible whole number result doesn't work.
- Given our constraints, it seems we need to find a combination where all numbers work together. Correcting the combination, we can work with: ((64 / 14) + 48) / 48.
- This evaluates to: 64 / 14 = 4.571428571, then adding 48: 4.5714 + 48 = 52.5714, and dividing by 48: 52.5714 / 48 = 1.096. This is still not right.
- The 64 - (48 / 14) = 57.1429 / 48 = 1.197 is close to our expected answer.
- Finally, by trying 64 - (48 / 14) / 14 is not yielding the correct answer, instead, we need to correctly calculate 64 / 14 - (48 - 14), which calculates: 64 / 14 = 4.571428571, then subtract 34 (48 - 14), 4.571428571 - 34 = -32.42857143, which still does not work.
- We recheck the logic of utilizing 64 - 48 and manipulations, noticing 64 - 34 = 30, hence using a simpler calculation: 64 - 48 + 14 = 30.

<think> To create an equation equaling 100 using the numbers 90, 78, and 68 exactly once, we need to consider combining them using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Initially, let's see if any of these numbers can be directly used in a simple operation.
The biggest number is 90, and subtracting 68 from 90 gives us 22, which is quite close to what we need. Now, if we add 78 to that result:
90 - 68 = 22
22 + 78 = 100
So, it looks like we can create the equation using these values in the exact way they appear.</think>
<answer> 90 - 68 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the possible combinations using the given numbers: 32, 57, and 60. We need to reach the target number 85.
- 60 + 57 = 117 (this is too high)
- 60 + 32 = 92 (this is also too high)
- 57 + 32 = 89 (this is close to 85, but still a bit high)
- 57 - 32 = 25 (we can use this to work towards our goal)
If we use 57 - 32 = 25, then we need to get from 25 to 85. We can achieve this by adding 60.
So, the equation becomes: 57 - 32 + 60 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (57 - 32) + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 67, and 65 that equals 11. Let's start by considering combinations of these numbers with the basic arithmetic operations. One way to get to 11 from these numbers might be using subtraction or division.
- Trying combinations, 65 - 67 does not work.
- 65 - 9 = 56, 67 - 9 = 58, and neither equals 11.
- Now trying 67 - 65, we get 2, and 65 - 2 = 63, still not 11.
- Let's try multiplication: 9 * 67 = 603, 65 * 67 = 4355, and obviously multiplication by 9 or 65 doesn't get us to 11.
- Now, let's try division: 65 / 67, 9 / 65 don't work.
- Considering the numbers 9 and 67, I could try 9 + 67 - 65. 
- If 9 + 67 = 76 and 76 - 65 = 11, this works!
So, the equation 9 + 67 - 65 equals 11. </think>
<answer> (9 + 67) - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 73 using the numbers 83, 36, and 26. One approach is to consider the subtraction as it could help in reaching the target number.
If I subtract 26 from 83, I get 57. Now I need to get from 57 to 73 by adding a number from the remaining list (36). 
57 + 36 = 93, which is not 73. But if I use division, 57 / 36 = 1.5833..., which isn't an integer number.
However, I can try another combination: 57 - 26 = 31. Now I need to reach 73 from 31. 
I can get 31 by subtracting 36 from 67. Since 67 isn't directly available, I might have to reconsider my additions and subtractions.
Considering the target 73, if I add 31 to another number from the list, I should check 36 + 37. But since 37 isn't available, I could use 36 - 3 = 33. This gets us 31 + 33 = 64, which still isn't our target.
For a more direct approach, since reversing operations often help, I think about multiplying or dividing in a way that might work with our numbers.
Observing the target of 73, let's try 83 - 36 = 47. If we add 26 to this 47, I get 47 + 26 = 73. This works!
So, the valid equation would be 83 - 36 + 26 = 73. </think>
<answer> 83 - 36 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that utilizes the numbers 29, 22, and 3 to equal 95. 
Starting by looking at 29, I can immediately see that 29 is the largest number. If we subtract 22 from 29, we get 7.
29 - 22 = 7
Now, to get closer to 95, I can multiply 7 by 3:
7 * 3 = 21
This gives me 21, and I need to get to 95. 
To get from 21 to 95, I need to add 74, but I only have 22 and 3 left. I need to find a way to use these numbers to get to 74.
Adding 22 and 3 gives me 25, which is not 74. 
Instead, let's consider if I can use multiplication between the remaining numbers. 
Multiplying 22 by 3 gives me 66, and then I can add 29 to get to 95.
95 = 29 + (22 * 3)
</think>
<answer>29 + (22 * 3)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers [24, 13, 46] to make 83. Let's try to isolate the largest number first, which is 46. 
If I use 46 as it is, I'll need to find a way to make up the difference (83 - 46 = 37) using the remaining numbers 24 and 13.
Now, 37 can be made by adding 24 and 13 (since 24 + 13 = 37).
So the equation I'm creating is: 46 + 24 + 13 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 24 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that equals 74 using the numbers 89, 44, and 29. Let's start by looking at the target sum and the numbers we have. 74 is quite close to 89, so we might consider subtraction or addition. Since 89 - 74 = 15 (which is not in the list), subtraction isn't feasible. Let's try addition: 89 + 44 = 133, which is too large. Now let's try to reduce 89 - 44 = 45. That's still not 74. Let's think of division or combining numbers in other ways. If I take 89 - 44, the result is 45, and if I then use the number 29 in some way, we might get close to 74. 45 - 29 = 16, which is still not 74. Now if we add 29 back to 16, we get 45 + 29 = 74. So, the equation that works is 89 - 44 + 29 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 44 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination using the numbers 64, 76, 93, and 60 to make 21. I notice 93 is quite large and 64 is relatively small. There's a good chance I might need to use subtraction. Let's try 93 - 64 and see if that leaves us with a number close to 21. 93 - 64 = 29. Now, I need to get to 21 with the remaining numbers 76 and 60. If I subtract 60 from 76, I get 16. Now, 29 - 16 gives me 13, which is not the solution. But let's try another combination: subtract 76 from 93. This gets me 17. Now I need to get to 21 with 60 and 64. To get from 17 to 21, I subtract 4. Given the numbers we have, 64 - 60 = 4. Therefore, the solution is 93 - 76 + 64 - 60 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 76 + 64 - 60 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 44, 2, and 6 to get 36. First, let's consider the use of multiplication or division for potentially getting a larger number. Using 44 and 6 together gives us 264, which is far too large. Using 264 and division with another number will produce a number much smaller than 36. So let's consider combining all numbers. 
Now, I notice that the operation of subtraction can bring us close to our target number. If we start by subtracting 6 from 44, we get 38. This leaves us with 2, which if subtracted from 38, results in 36. Thus, the equation becomes 44 - 6 - 2 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 44 - 6 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 10, 4, and 39 that equals 45. First, let's see how these numbers relate to 45. Adding larger numbers like 10 and 39 gives 49, which is closer to the target but a bit too high. Subtracting might bring us closer. Let's subtract 4 from 39 first and then add 10: 39 - 4 = 35. Now we have 35 and 10. To reach 45 from 35, adding 10 will work. Thus, the equation should be: 39 - 4 + 10 = 45.
</think>
<answer>39 - 4 + 10</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and the target result. We have 27, 47, and 11, and we need to form an equation that equals 85.
Looking at the numbers, we notice that 47 is quite close to 85, so it might be a good candidate for being used as is or transformed. If we add 11 to 47, we get 58, which is still far from 85. So, adding another number might help bridge this gap.
Now, considering 27, it doesn't seem to fit directly into some simple operation to reach our target. However, it could potentially be involved in taking away from our sum to reach 85.
47 + 11 equals 58, and if we add 27 to 58, we get 85. So the equation could be 47 + 11 + 27 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 47 + 11 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 27, 47, and 11 to make 85. 
First, let's try to use 47 as it is a large number and adding/subtracting/ dividing by it might bring us closer to 85.
Let's consider adding 27 to 47, which equals 74. 
Then, we need 11 more to reach 85. 
So, 47 + 27 = 74, and we need 11 more which is 85. This gives us the equation: (47 + 27) + 11.
Now let's verify the calculation: 47 + 27 equals 74, and 74 + 11 equals 85.
</think>
<answer>(47 + 27) + 11</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 59, 54, and 69 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to reach 74. 
First, I'll consider adding and subtracting these numbers. 
69 + 54 = 123
123 - 59 = 64
This brings me closer, but not quite there. 
Now, consider multiplying and dividing:
69 * 54 = 3726 (too big)
69 / 59 = 1.1633 (not an integer, and doesn't seem helpful here)
54 * 59 = 3186 (too large)
54 / 69 = 0.7824 (not an integer, and doesn't seem helpful here)
So, adding and subtracting seems more promising. Let's think about removing one of the bigger numbers to get closer to 74.
74 - 54 = 20, or 74 - 69 = 5
Since 74 - 54 = 20, we can use 20 from 59 and 54.
59 - 54 + 69 = 20 + 69 = 89 - 15 = 74
So, we've found our equation: 59 - 54 + 69 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 54 + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 17, 36, and 51 exactly once, with basic arithmetic to end up with 70. I'll start by examining the numbers to see if any of them can be used as they are or through an operation.
One observation is that if I subtract 17 from 51, I get 34. This is closer to our target number but not quite there. Next, I notice that 36 is not far from 34, which suggests a suitable way to get 70. 
If I add 36 to 34 (or 17 from 51), I get 50. To reach 70, I need to add 20. If I multiply 17 by 2, I get 34, which is good, but I need 6. Since I've already considered 36, 34, and 17, I need another approach.
Alternatively, multiplying 17 by 2 gives 34, and if I add 36 to that, I get 50. To reach 70, I need to add 20. If I divide 36 by 3, I get 12, and then to get to 70, I just need 58. 
When I divide 36 by 3, I get 12. Multiplying 12 by 4 should give me 48, and then adding 22 to reach 70. But that leaves no use for 51.
Another idea comes to mind - what if I divide 51 by 3, I get 17. Then to reach 70, I would need 53. Since I've already considered 51, I need another strategy.
Finally, I consider adding 17 to 51 first to get 68, and then adding 36 to reach 104 - this is too high. If I try subtracting 17 from 51 first, then subtracting the larger number from the result gives 34, and then subtracting the smaller remaining number from this result should give me 70.
17 - 51 = -34, and -34 - 17 = -51, which is not 70.
Let's try a final possibility, and reduce the steps. Subtract 17 from 51 and then add 36 to get the result.
51 - 17 = 34, and then 34 + 36 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 17) + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider how the numbers might add up or subtract to get close to 82. Multiplying or dividing might yield numbers closer to 82 or be necessary to create the final number.
Looking at the numbers 40, 18, and 24, 40 seems to be the biggest and could be the main contributor.
40 + 18 + 24 = 82, but we can't use each number once with just addition or should we?
Let's consider multiplication or division:
18 * 24 = 432, which is too large.
40 * 24 = 960, which is much too large.
Considering using the division next:
(40 * 24) / 18 = 53.33, which is close but not 82.
Now, let's try subtraction:
40 - 18 - 24 = 8
This is not 82, but it got us closer by a large margin.
Thinking about combining these, we should try the 40, 24 with subtraction and division:
(40 - 24) / 18 = 16 / 18, which is not 82.
Then, we can add the remaining number 18:
(40 - 24) / 18 + 18 = 16/18 + 18, simplifying this is complicated, so let's try another approach:
40 + (18 * 24 / 100) which is 40 + 0. 432, not an integer and not 82.
Finally, let's try a more complex thinking process:
(40 - 18) / 24 = 22 / 24 which is simplifying to 11/12, not helping directly.
Another approach could be:
(40 + 24) * (18 / 100) which simplifies to 64 * 0. 18, not a useful fraction.
I see I've been going in circles, so let’s return to basics:
Given the numbers must come out the same, 40 + 24 + 18 = 82, but not using each number once.
The goal seems seems to be tying them together in a single operation. Let me re-check these steps. Indeed adding them up works but conforms to the rules:
40 + 18 + 24 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 18 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 18, and 24. We need to create an equation that equals 82 using each number only once and any combination of basic arithmetic operations.
Since 82 is fairly close to 40 and 24, it seems likely that we'll use subtraction or addition to reach the desired result.
If we subtract 24 from 82, we're left with 58. Then, we need to make 58 from 40 and 18 using the allowed operations.
Adding 40 and 18 gives us 58, which is exactly what we need.
Thus, the equation would be: 82 = 40 + 18 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 18 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve an equation that equals 82 using the numbers 40, 18, and 24 exactly once, we need to try different combinations of arithmetic operations. One strategy could be utilizing multiplication or division to reach a higher number and then adjust with addition or subtraction.
Let's start by trying to use multiplication on any of the given numbers. Multiplying 24 by 3 would give 72, which is close to 82. Adding 10 might help reach 82.
Considering 40 as 4*10, we can use division and addition to get 10 from the remaining numbers, 18 and 24. But doing 18 / 24 will yield a fraction, so let's try 18 - 24.
18 - 24 = -6, and then adding 4*10 = 40 gives us:
(18 - 24) + (4 * 10) = -6 + 40 = 34, which is not 82.
Let's try using addition and subtraction differently. We can think of using 18 and 24 in combination. Adding 18 and 24 gives us 42. Now we need an extra 40 to reach 82. We can get 40 by using the number 40 without any operation.
So the equation becomes 18 + 24 + 40 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 18 + 24 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 30, 25, 71, and 97 to get a result of 81. 
I notice that 97 and 71 add up to 168, which is close to 169. If I could use subtraction between these two numbers, I might be able to adjust the result further.
Subtracting 71 from 97 gives 26. 
Now I have the numbers 30, 25, 26, and 81. 
The numbers 30 and 25 can be added together to make 55. 
Now I have the numbers 55, 26, and 81. 
The only way then to reach 81 using these numbers is 55 + 26. 
So the equation would be: 30 + 25 + (97 - 71) = 81.
</think>
<answer> (30 + 25) + (97 - 71)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 54 using the given numbers: 12, 85, 23, and 20. 
- Let's start by considering if any combination of the numbers themselves can achieve the result. None of the numbers alone or in pairs add up to 54.
- Now let's consider the possibility of using the operations. I can combine 85 - 23 to get 62, which is close to 54. Subtracting 8 from 62 seems a logical place to get 54. However, we don't have the number 8.
- I should consider if there's a way to get 8 from the provided numbers without using any of them directly. 20 - 12 = 8, this could work.
- So the equation becomes: (85 - 23) - (20 - 12) = 54.
</think>
<answer>(85 - 23) - (20 - 12)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number we want to reach: 58. 
Then I'll look at the numbers available: 60, 25, and 93. 
Since 93 is way above 58, it's better to try with 60 or 25.
If I use 60, I can subtract to get closer to 58. 
60 - 25 = 35, which is closer.
Next, I need to get from 35 to 58. 
I can add 35 + 23, but 23 is not in the set.
If I use 93, it doesn't help because subtracting 25 from it would give me 68, which is too high.
Considering I can use basic arithmetic operations, the best option is to use 25 and subtract it from 60 to get 35, and then add the missing 23, but since that number is not available, I'll need to look back.
Looking back, I see I need 23 which is 93 - 70. But 70 is not a number provided. No other combination seems to work with these numbers.
After trying the combinations, it's clear I need to rethink. The solution might involve different operations than what I thought initially.
A better approach might be using the number 93 in a different way. Let's try subtracting it from 60 and then adding 25.
93 - 60 = 33
Now, 33 + 25 = 58
</think>
<answer> 93 - 60 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to construct an equation that uses the given numbers 61, 60, and 75 to equal 76. 
One possible combination is: 75 - 60 + 61. 
However, 75 - 60 + 61 is actually 76, which meets our requirement.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 60 + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all the possible combinations of the three numbers using the given operations and try to see if they could fit the equation to equal 76. One way to start might be to consider multiplying or dividing and then subtracting or adding.
I see the number 75 - 60 equals 15, so I can work with the remaining 61.
By adding 61 to this result (15 + 61 = 76), we get our target number.
So the equation would be 61 + (75 - 60) = 76.
</think>
<answer> 61 + (75 - 60) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 36, 58, and 18 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to achieve the result of 76. 
Starting with 58 seems likely, as it's close to our target. Let's subtract 18 from 58 first: 58 - 18 = 40.
Now our equation looks like: 40 + x = 76. To isolate x, we subtract 40 from 76, which gives us: 76 - 40 = 36.
Therefore, we have the following equation: 58 - 18 + 36 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 18 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number I need to reach, which is 73. Next, I'll look at the numbers provided: 7, 20, and 60. A good starting point might be to use 60 as the base since it's the largest number and will help me get close to 73.
One approach could be to use 60 plus a smaller number that, when added to it, equals 73. Here, 20 fits this requirement since 60 + 20 = 80, which is 7 less than 73.
Therefore, we need to subtract 7 from 80 to get 73.
The equation then becomes: (60 + 20) - 7 = 73.
</think>
<answer>(60 + 20) - 7</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 70, 12, and 51. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 31.
I notice that 70 - 51 = 19, which is close to 31. By adding 12 to this result, I can reach 31.
Therefore, the equation would be: 70 - 51 + 12 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 51 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 55, and 96 that equals 94. Starting with the numbers as they are, let's consider operations that might help approach 94. Subtracting 55 from 96 gives me 41, which is close to 94. Now I need to get from 41 to 94 by using the third number, 53. Clearly, 53 - 41 = 12 is insufficient. Instead, I can add 53 to 41 to get 94. So the equation that works is 53 + (96 - 55) = 94.
</think>
<answer> 53 + (96 - 55) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 44, 73, 99, and 55. We need to create an equation that equals 37 using each number only once along with basic arithmetic operations.
- Starting with the numbers, let's try subtracting some of them: 99 - 73 = 26.
- Now, we need 10 more to reach 37 (26 + 10 = 37). 
- The only way to get 10 from the remaining numbers 44 and 55 is by subtracting 55 from 44 and then using the 55 we had left.
- So, we get 44 - 55 = -11.
- Now, if we take our 26 from earlier and subtract 11, we get 26 - 11 = 15.
- But we need 10, so let's see if we can break down the -11 further.
- We can get -11 by using the 55 + (-44). Therefore, -11 = 55 - 44.
- Now, if we substitute that, we get 26 - (55 - 44) and simplifying that gives us 26 - 55 + 44 = 15.
- We need to put in a negative sign so that we get the final result of -15, but this is close. However, we need to adjust the result to get 37.
- If we multiply 15 by -2, we get -30. But we need 37. 
- Considering further possibilities, if we take 55 and do 99 - 55, we get 44. And then do 44 - 73, we get -29, which is close, but not reaching 37.
- If we rearrange, let's consider: (55 - (99 - 73)) * -1 = 55 - 26 = 29. This isn't correct yet.
- Finally, a strategic approach: 99 - (73 + 55) = 99 - 128. This is incorrect.
- Upon reviewing all possibilities, another successful calculation is: 99 - 55 = 44, then 44 - 73 = -29, but we need to tweak it: (-55 + 99) - 73 = -29. This is still wrong.
- A simpler check shows us: (99 - 73) + (55 - 44) = 26 + 11 = 37.
</think>
<answer>(99 - 73) + (55 - 44)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 43, 20, and 15. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 43 + 15 is 58, which is close to 78. Then, 78 - 58 = 20. So, combining these parts, I can see that (43 + 15) + 20 = 78.
</think>
<answer>(43 + 15) + 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider possible operations that could lead to 22 using the numbers 95, 31, and 42. Since we are aiming to get 22, a subtraction operation seems promising, as it can adjust the higher numbers to the target number. 
Let's start by trying to subtract smaller numbers from 95. If we subtract 31 from 95, we get 64. Now we need to get from 64 to 22 using only 42. One way to do this is to subtract 42 from 64, which gives us 22. This seems to work.
So the equation would be: 95 - 31 - 42 = 22.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 31 - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 18, 72, and 44 to get a result of 46. 
Looking at the numbers, 72 - 44 is 28, which is close to 46 and leaves us with 18 to deal with.
Now, to reduce the number 28 to 46, might be adding an appropriate number. But 18 is much bigger than it needs to be. 
Let's consider division as it could reduce the values down. Dividing 72 by 44 gives us approximately 1.63, not exactly a useable number for reaching 46.
Next, I think about the subtraction of 18 from 44, which equals 26.
Now we need 8 more to reach the target of 46, which we can get from 72 ÷ 44's possible fractional part.
But rather than using the fraction, a simple approach is to look at using 18 and 44 directly with arithmetic operations.
What if we rearrange the idea and try using a fraction? We can use 72 ÷ (44 / 2) = 72 ÷ 22 = 3.27 which isn't exact. 
Then we think if maybe using 18 directly, 18 - 16 = 2, then 72 - 22 = 46.
So, using these numbers, the equation would be 72 - (44 - 18) = 46.
</think>
<answer> 72 - (44 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 20, 19, and 66. We need to use these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations to get 67.
One way to approach this is to start with the largest number, 66. We can try subtracting a smaller number from 66 to see if we can get closer to 67.
If we take 66 - 19 = 47, which is not 67. So 19 is too high.
Now let's try 66 - 20 = 46. Again, not 67.
Since 46 is still not 67, we can try to add numbers to it to reach 67. Adding 21 to 46 gives us 67, but 21 is not in our set of numbers.
What if we add 20 to 19? That would give us 39, which is still not 67. Adding 20 + 19 = 39 and then continuing to look for the final number to reach 67 isn't leading us closer.
We might need to consider intermediate steps. If we see how far from 67 we are, then adjust. Since 67 - 66 = 1 and we have a 19, something like 19 + 1 = 20, then we would need 66 - 4 = 62, but 4 is not in our numbers set either.
We can consider combinations of operations. For instance, if we start with 20 + 19 = 39 and try to get to 67, we'd need 67 - 39 = 28. We could then add 66 to 28, but that uses 66 twice. 
The only strategy left is to check if we could combine the numbers using subtraction and addition differently. Let's see if we can use the operations to directly get to 67:
19 + 66 - 20 = 65 would be close. To get to 67 from 65, we need to add 2. There is no direct way to combine 20 and 19 to get 2, but 20 - 18 = 2, and 18 isn't available. So this route isn't working.
Instead, another solution would be: 66 - 19 + 20 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 19 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the options we have. We need to use the numbers 2, 87, 7 exactly once, and they must combine to make 40. 
Let's begin by looking at the sum and difference of the numbers:
- 87 + 2 = 89 (too high)
- 87 - 2 = 85 (too high)
- 87 - 7 = 80 (too high)
- 87 + 7 = 94 (too high)
Multiplying or dividing these numbers alone won't get us exactly 40. Let's consider rearranging and combining them using multiplication and division.
Now, consider the pairs 2 and 7, 2 and 87, and 7 and 87:
- 7 * 2 = 14 (less than 40)
- 87 / 7 = 12.42 which isn't an integer
None of these options are exact, so let's consider other possible combinations like this. Let's try:
(87 - 7) / 2 = 40
Let's verify:
- 87 - 7 = 80
- 80 / 2 = 40
This works! Therefore, the equation is (87 - 7) / 2 = 40. </think>
<answer>(87 - 7) / 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what operations we can use. We need to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division on the numbers 63, 87, and 94 to get 56. 
We can start by checking if any of the numbers can be combined with the others using simple arithmetic. Clearly, no straightforward combination will give us 56 using just those three numbers. 
Next, let's look at the inverse operations - perhaps we can divide one of the numbers to get a useful intermediate result. 
If we take 94 / 2, we get 47, but this doesn't get us to 56 directly. 
Let's try 94 - 87 = 7. Now, we need to get 56 from 7 and 63. 
If we can use 63 - 7 = 56, then we have a solution. Let's check: 63 - 7 = 56.
So we have our solution: 63 - (94 - 87) = 56.
</think>
<answer>63 - (94 - 87)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach the result of 89 using the numbers 33, 5, and 51. Let's start by considering if we can use multiplication or addition to reach this. The number 51 seems promising because adding 51 to 33 would give 84, which is close to 89. The difference between 89 and 84 is 5. Therefore, we need to make 5 using 5, which is straightforward with simple arithmetic.
51 + 33 = 84.
Now, to get to 89, we add 5 to 84: 84 + 5 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 33 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 38, 2, and 60 that equals 96. 
Given that 60 is a large number, it might be useful to subtract it from 96 to simplify the problem.
96 - 60 = 36. Now I have to express 36 using 38 and 2. 
If I take away 2 from 38, I get 36, which fits exactly.
So the equation becomes: (38 - 2) + 60 = 96.
</think>
<answer>(38 - 2) + 60</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 5, 69, and 14. We need to form an equation that equals 50. 
- 69 is a large number and seems difficult to manipulate to get close to 50.
- 14 can be subtracted from 50 to give 36. 
- 5, when used as it is, might help us reach the number 36.
Given 14 - 5 = 9, we need an additional 27 from 36 to reach 50. We can use 5 * 5 = 25, which is close to 27. But 5 * 5 = 25 doesn't leave enough to reach 50.
5 + 14 = 19, which is not the solution. But we can consider the reverse operation and use division or combination in a different way. Let's try using multiplication of 5 and 14.
5 * 14 = 70, but we need 50, so we can adjust by using subtraction instead of addition.
69 - 19 = 50. We achieved 19 by using 5 + 14. Hence, the equation would be:
69 - (5 + 14) = 50.
</think>
<answer> 69 - (5 + 14) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 98, 4, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 14 using these numbers exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations. 
Looking at 98 and 11, we see that 98 - 11 = 87. This is not close to 14, so let's try combining it with 4.
(98 - 11) + 4 = 87 + 4 = 91. This is still far from 14.
Now let's think about a different combination. What if we use 4 and 11 in a different way to possibly get closer to 14?
11 - 4 = 7. Now we have 98 and 7, but 98 - 7 = 91 still isn't right.
If we use 4 to modify 98 or 11, division or multiplication would seem plausible since 98 is much larger. 
Since we want to get to 14, dividing 98 by 7 would be a logical step. However, 7 isn't available directly, we should try to create it using 11 and 4.
11 - 4 = 7, so far, so good. Now let's divide 98 by 7.
98 / 7 = 14. This equals our target number 14.
Combining all of this together, we get: 98 / (11 - 4) = 14.
</think>
<answer> 98 / (11 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 28, 56, and 31. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to equal 53.
One way to start is by looking at the larger numbers 56 and 31, which if combined could give us a result close to our target:
56 - 31 = 25
Now we have 25 and we need to reach 53. We need to add 28 to this result:
25 + 28 = 53
So the expression using all three numbers is: 56 - 31 + 28
</think>
<answer>56 - 31 + 28</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 50, 57, and 53 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 46. Let's start by looking at the differences and sums of these numbers to see if we can simplify things.
- The difference between 57 and 53 is 4.
- The sum of 50 and 53 is 103.
- 57 - 53 + 50 - 53 = 4 implies we need to rearrange the operations slightly.
Notice that if we rearrange the numbers 50 and 53 and add 57 to them, we get 50 + 53 + 57 - 57. This shows that the equation should be 50 + 53 - 57.
</think>
<answer> 50 + 53 - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers I have: 25, 43, 56, and 55. I need to use them exactly once to make 67 using basic arithmetic operations. 
25 + 43 = 68 is close but then I need to subtract 1 to reach 67. 
56 - 55 = 1. 
So, combining 25 + 43 - (56 - 55) equals 67.
</think>
<answer> (25 + 43) - (56 - 55) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 16, 85, and 35. These don't immediately suggest a straightforward way to add up to 66 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Now, looking at the numbers more closely:
- 85 is relatively large, 66 is relatively small.
- 35 is in between 16 and 85, and it is not divisible by either 16 or 85 that we can use to get close to 66.
I recognize that mixing the operation might be necessary. If I look at subtraction:
- 85 - 35 = 50 (which is too far from 66), but this gives me a clue.
Now, looking at 16, if I can use it in a way to make up the difference:
- 85 - 35 = 50, then to get to 66, I need 16 + 50 = 66.
So, the equation will be 85 - 35 + 16.
</think>
<answer>85 - 35 + 16</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to generate an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 16, 85, and 35, each only once. Let's start by considering the possible operations:
- Adding 16 and 85 gives 101.
- Subtracting 35 from 85 gives 50.
- Multiplying 16 and 35 gives 560, which is too large for our target number.
- Dividing 85 by 16 or 35 will not give a whole number and won't help us reach 66 either.
Considering subtraction and addition could be a straightforward approach. 85 - 16 = 69, close but not 66. If we subtract a smaller number, we need to compensate, addition might work.
Let's try 85 - 16 + 35:
This gives 85 - 16 = 69, then 69 + 35 = 104 which is not 66. 
Instead, subtracting 35 from 85 and then adding 16 does not achieve 66 immediately.
That leaves 85 + 16 - 35:
This gives 85 + 16 = 101, then 101 - 35 = 66.
So, 85 + 16 - 35 = 66.
</think>
<answer>85 + 16 - 35</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination using the numbers 53, 70, and 66 that will give me 83. 
I see that 70 - 66 = 4. 
Now, if I add 53 to 4, I get 53 + 4 = 57 which is not equal to 83.
However, I can reverse the order of operations and do (70 - 66) + 53 = 4 + 53 = 57 + 26, but this introduces the number 26 which isn't in the set.
Another way to think about it is to see if I could use the numbers in a different sequence.
If I take 70 and subtract 53, I get 17. 
Then, if I add 66 to 17, I get 66 + 17 = 83.
This uses all unique numbers once and equals 83.
</think>
<answer> 66 + (70 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 64 using the numbers 32, 15, and 17. Let's consider these step by step:
1. One of these numbers must be multiplied by another to get close to 64. The number 32 is clearly a good candidate because 32 * 2 = 64, which is exactly what we need.
2. Since 32 is already in the form of the desired result, I can use 32 * 2 directly.
3. Now, I need to create a value of 2 using 15 and 17. There are a few ways to do this but the simplest one is to subtract 17 - 15 = 2.
4. So, the final equation that works is: 32 * (17 - 15).
</think>
<answer>32 * (17 - 15)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 33, 79, and 55 exactly once, that results in 57. 
Looking at the numbers, 79 seems quite large and 55 seems too small to subtract from or add to 33 to get 57. So, let's consider an operation that could bring the sum or difference closer to 57.
If I take 55 and subtract it from 79, I get 24. Now, I need to get to 57 from 24 using 33. 
Adding 33 to 24 gives me 57, which is what I need. 
So, the equation will be: 79 - 55 + 33 = 57.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 55 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 79, and 55 that results in 57. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try an equation like: (79 - 55) + 33
(79 - 55) equals 24.
Then adding 33 to 24 gives us 57.
(79 - 55) + 33 = 24 + 33 = 57
So the equation is correct and uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer>(79 - 55) + 33</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 9, 4, and 54. We need to create an equation that equals 10 using each number once and the basic arithmetic operations.
We see that 54 is a large number and 9 is relatively small. Subtracting 9 from 54 gives us 45, which is closer to 10, but still too far.
Let's try adding the smaller numbers: 9 + 4 = 13, which is far from 10.
Multiplying doesn't seem to get us closer to 10, as any product of 9, 4, and 54 will be much larger.
Let's try combining operations:
(54 - 9) / 4 = 45 / 4, which is not 10.
(9 - 54) / 4 only works as (9 - 54) / 4 = -4.5, not a valid solution.
So far, none of these operations seem to help us reach exactly 10. Let's try another approach - dividing:
54 / 9 = 6, but we need a difference of 4 to get 2, which isn't useful.
Let's try -9 + 4 + 54 = 49, which is still not 10.
Finally, let's try (54 - 9) / 4 + 4 = 45 / 4 + 4 = 11.25 + 4 = 10.25, which is close but not exact.
Let's reconsider the order of division and addition:
54 / (9 - 4) = 54 / 5 = 10.8, which is close but not exact.
The solution must involve another way to use these numbers. Let's try:
4 + (54 / 9) = 4 + 6 = 10.
</think>
<answer> 4 + (54 / 9) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 16, and 44 that equals 68. The operations we can use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's try different combinations of these operations.
- First, I notice that 40 + 16 + 44 = 100, which is too high. Combining 40 and 44 directly gives 84, which is close but needs to get to 68.
- Then, 40 - 16 = 24.
- Now we have 24 + 44 which is 68. So, the operations seem to work.
Therefore, the equation is 40 - 16 + 44 = 68.
</think>
<answer> 40 - 16 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the three numbers given: 40, 16, and 44. 
A straightforward way to reach 68 using these numbers could be through addition or subtraction.
1. If we add these numbers together, we get 40 + 16 + 44 = 100.
   That doesn't work as we need 68.
2. Subtracting the smallest number from the total gets us closer: 40 + 44 - 16 = 68.
This matches our target, so we can use - as our arithmetic operation between 40 and 44, and add 16 to reach 68.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 44 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 89, 20, and 45 to make 64. One approach could be using some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Multiplying 89 and 20 gives 1780, which is far from 64. So, that might not work. Now, let's try another combination.
If I subtract 45 from 89, I get 44. Then, I need to add 20 to 44 to get to 64. This combination works.
(89 - 45) + 20 = 64
</think>
<answer>(89 - 45) + 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers and operations. We have 89, 20, and 45 available. To get 64, it seems adding or subtracting would overshoot or fall short. Multiplying 89 by any of the other two numbers or dividing falls short too, given 89 is significantly larger. However, 89 - 20 = 69 is close, but a bit too high. 
Now, let's consider dividing 89 by 20, which gives 4.45. This is not 64, but if we then add 45 to this result, we get:
4.45 + 45 = 49. 45.
This is still not 64, so I need to reconsider.
Next, let's try another combination: what if we take 89 - 45 = 44. Then if we divide by 20, we get:
44 / 20 = 2. 2.
This is still not 64.
I notice I have not yet used the number 45 in any significant way in the equation so far. Let's add another 45 to the mix:
89 - 45 + 45 = 44.
44 is close to 64, but I need 20 more. We haven't used 20 yet. If I multiply 44 by 1. 5 (because 64 / 44 = 1. 4545, which is close to 1. 5), I get:
44 * 1. 5 = 66, which is slightly too high.
Let's try another approach by using 20 directly:
89 - 45 + 20 = 64.
This gives exactly what we need.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 45 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 27, 32, and 28 to make 31. Looking at these numbers, I can start by examining the possibilities for subtraction. If I subtract 32 from 32 (regardless of what I do with the other numbers), I end up with 0, which isn't helpful. Moving to addition, adding 27 and 28 gives me 55, which is too large for what I need. 
So, looking at the remaining basic operations, I consider multiplication and division. If I multiply 27 by any of the other numbers, I exceed 31. And if I divide 32 or 28 by 27, I get non-integer results which are not suitable.
This leaves me with subtraction as the most viable option. To get from 32 to 31, I need to subtract 1. I need to get 1 from the numbers 27 and 28. Subtracting 27 from 28 gives me 1. So, the equation is 32 - 28 + 27 = 31.
</think>
<answer>32 - 28 + 27</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll identify the numbers we have: 35, 6, and 30. We need to form an equation that equals 71 using these numbers exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, and /. Let's see if we can get close by trying different combinations.
One way to approach this is to see if we can add or subtract numbers to reach our target of 71. We can try:
1. Adding 35 to 30 gives us 65. Now, we need to reach 71 from 65 by using the remaining number (6). Adding 6 to 65 doesn't work since 65 + 6 = 71, but we can't use 6 later.
2. Subtracting 30 from 35 gives us 5. Now we need to reach 71 from 5 using the remaining number (6). Substituting 6 into 5 * 6 = 30 doesn't work here since we already used 6. Subtracting 6 from 5 is not possible since it becomes negative.
3. Multiplying 35 and 6 gives us 210. Then, subtracting 30 from 210 doesn't work as 210 - 30 = 180, not 71.
4. Multiplying 35 and 30 gives us 105. Subtracting 6 from 105 doesn't work as 105 - 6 = 99.
5. Adding 6 to 35 gives us 41, then adding 30 to 41 gives 71. This seems promising! We've used all the numbers only once.
</think>
<answer> (35 + 6) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 37, 38, 35, and 34 using basic arithmetic operations to get 76. Let's start by adding 37 and 38, which gives us 75. That’s close to 76. We just need an additional 1 to reach 76. Seeing that 34 and 35 total to 69, subtracting 34 from this (35 - 34 = 1) will give us exactly what we need. Therefore, the equation is (37 + 38) - 34 + 35 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (37 + 38) - 34 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 95, 13, and 20. The goal is to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get 62.
We can start by considering the value of the first two numbers, 95 and 13. If we subtract 13 from 95, we get 82, which is quite close to 62. However, we need to reduce this by 20 to get to 62. The number 20 is one of our given numbers, so we can use it to subtract 20 from 82 to get 62.
So the equation becomes: 95 - 13 - 20 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 13 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have and what kind of combination can result in 13 using the allowed operations. The numbers are 71, 5, and 53. We need to use each number exactly once. 

Trying out combinations:
- 71 - 53 = 18 (not 13)
- 71 - 5 = 66 (not 13)
- 53 - 5 = 48 (not 13)
- 71 / 5 = 14.2 (not an integer, thus not 13)
- 53 / 5 = 10.6 (not an integer, thus not 13)
- 51 - 53 = -2 (not 13)
- 53 + 5 = 58 (not 13)

We tried basic arithmetic with each of the numbers individually, but no combinations are working out. Now let's try mixing the numbers using different operations:
- Using 71 + 53 - 5: 71 + 53 - 5 = 120 - 5 = 115 (not 13)

Given these attempts, there seems to be a mistake. However, let's reconsider and see if we missed something. We can try a different combination like (71 - 53) - 5:

- 71 - 53 = 18 (one of the operations used on numbers provided, a better fit)
- 18 - 5 = 13 (this equals 13)

This combination fits the criteria. Let's express this properly:
</think>
<answer>(71 - 53) - 5</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 71, 5, and 53 to equal 13. One effective way is to use subtraction. 
71 is the largest number, so if we subtract 53 and 5 from it, we should see if we can get close to 13.
71 - 53 = 18
Now we have 18 - 5 = 13, which is exactly what we need. So the equation will incorporate these steps.
</think>
<answer> (71 - 53) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 89, 50, and 79. Since we want to end up with 60, we should look at how these numbers can be combined with basic arithmetic operations.
One good place to start is to look at the operations. Addition and subtraction will not work here because the numbers are far apart and adding or subtracting one or several will not get us close to 60. Multiplication and division seem promising.
Let's consider the largest number, 89. If we can create a combination that will result in 89 - something becoming 60, that could work.
89 - 29 = 60, but 29 is not a number we have. However, 50 + 30 = 80, and 80 - 10 = 70, which is close but not 89.
Another possibility is 89 - 29 = 60, but as mentioned, 29 is not in our set.
What if we use the sum of some numbers and subtract from 89 and then adjust?
89 - (50 + 79 / 2) = 89 - (50 + 39. 5) = 89 - 89. 5 = -0. 5. This is not correct.
So, let's try another approach.
Let's see what happens if we use 79 + 50 - 89:
79 + 50 - 89 = 2. However, this is not 60 either.
Now let me try another method involving order and subtraction:
(89 - 79) + 50 = 10 + 50 = 60.
So, we can use the numbers 89, 79, and 50, and the operations we need are:
(89 - 79) + 50 = 60.
</think>
<answer>(89 - 79) + 50</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 27, 35, 6, and 94 to create an equation that equals 26 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Looking at the numbers, 35 - 94 gives -59, which is not helpful. We need to consider other operations.
Considering subtraction, if I use 94 - 35 = 59, we can't reach 26 using this. Then 59 - 27 = 32, still far from 26.
Considering addition, if I use 27 + 35 = 62, it's too large. If I reduce by 94, I'll get -68, which isn't helpful.
Considering multiplication, 27 * 6 = 162, which is too large. If I reduce by 35, 162 - 35 = 127, still not useful.
Considering division, 35 / 6 gives approximately 5. 83, bringing me no closer.
It looks like I might need to rethink the application of operations. 35 / 6 gives approximately 5. 83, so multiplying this by 27 gives about 153, far from 26.
If I use 35 / 6 * 27, the result is not 26. I need another approach.
Let's try 27 - (35 / 6). This will give approximately 24. 83, still not 26. Other combinations like 27 - (35 / 6) + 94 will lead to a very large number.
A different approach could be to use 6 * 4.33 ≈ 26, but 35 / 6 is not an exact fraction.
Instead, let's consider 94 - 35 - 27, which equals 32. We can subtract another number to get 26. 
So, 94 - 35 - 27 - 6 = 26.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 35 - 27 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 92, 51, and 51 to get 47 as the result. Let's try to use simple arithmetic operations on these numbers to reach our target. 
Firstly, 92 - 45 = 47, but we can't use 45 twice. 
Secondly, 51 + 51 = 102, which is too high and we can't simply subtract numbers to reach 47 without duplicating 51.
Now, if I rearrange, there seems to be no obvious way to add or subtract the numbers together to get 47. However, if we consider multiplication or division, we can see an opportunity. 
Observe that 92 * 51 / 51 = 92, and 92 - 45 = 47. This combination works.
</think>
<answer> (92 * 51) / 51 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 85, 4, and 78 to make an equation that equals 11. 
- 85 is a large number and 78 and 4 are much smaller. 
- Considering basic arithmetic operations, division or subtraction might be key to use these numbers in a way that the answer is 11.
- I see that subtracting 78 from 85 gives me 7. 
- Now, I need 4 more to reach 11. This means 11 - 7 = 4. 
- So, if I add 4 to 7, I get 11. 
- Therefore, the operation that works is 85 - 78 + 4 equals 11.
</think>
<answer> 85 - 78 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 76, 66, and 18 once each to get the result 28. Let's consider the numbers and see if any combination can give us 28. 
If we add 76 and 18, we get 94, which is too large. 
If we subtract 18 from 76, we get 58, which is still too large. 
Using multiplication won't help because multiplying any of these numbers by another won't give us 28.
Thus, it seems addition or subtraction might be involved. 
Now, if we look at 66, we notice that it can be manipulated by subtraction to get closer to 28. 
Let's try: 
76 + 66 - 18 = 134 - 18 = 116 - 88 = 28
This does not work, as we used all numbers and got 116 not 28. 
But, let's think in reverse: if we take 66 from 76, we get 10, and then we need 18 to get 28. 
So, 76 - 66 + 18 = 10 + 18 = 28
This combination works.
</think>
<answer>76 - 66 + 18</answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 19 using the numbers 54, 46, 31, and 88 with basic arithmetic operations, I'll need to consider how each number can contribute effectively.
First, observe that 88 is quite large and 54 is relatively small. We might need to use subtraction or division to make progress.
Let's try to express 19 in a way that utilizes 88 effectively. We see that 88 - 69 = 19. Now, can we form 69 using the other numbers 54, 46, and 31?
A possible way could be 54 - 31 = 23, and then 23 - 46 is not feasible. Instead, let's try 46 - 31 = 15, and then 23 - 15 = 8. Adding 54 to 8 gives us 62, which isn't 69 either.
We should consider another combination of operations. If we think about 88 - 69 and the numbers available, 54 and 46 can help. If we use subtraction for a feasible combination, we could try 54 - 31 = 23, and then 88 - 23 = 65, which is still not 19.
Next, let's try to use all numbers and operations in a different manner. We could write 88 - 54 = 34. Then if we use 46 - 31 = 15, and finally 34 - 15 = 19, this seems promising.
Thus, the equation would be: (88 - 54) - (46 - 31) = 19.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 54) - (46 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 18, 13, and 69. We need to get to 74 using these numbers along with basic arithmetic operations.
We can look at 69 - 13 = 56, which is close to 74. Now, we need 18 more.
The only way to get 18 from the remaining numbers is to use 18 itself.
Therefore, the equation is: 69 - 13 + 18 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 13 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that results in 65 using the numbers 29, 2, and 18 exactly once. I can start by looking at the target number and considering how I might combine these numbers using arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this is to consider if multiplication or addition of some of these numbers could push me closer to 65.
- If I multiply 29 by 2, I get 58, which is close but not quite 65.
- Adding 18 to 58 gives me 76, which is too high.
- If instead, I try dividing 65 by 2, I get 32.5, which isn't an integer and so not one of the numbers we have.
- Now let's consider a combination of operations:
- If I start with 18 * 2 = 36, and then add 29 to it, I get 65.
This combination works because 18 * 2 equals 36, and adding 29 to that gives exactly 65.
</think>
<answer> (18 * 2) + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 51, 41, and 37 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to equal 47. 
If I subtract 37 from 41, I get 4. 
Then, I need to get to 47 using the remaining number, 51. 
If I subtract 51 by 43, I don't get a usable result since 43 is not a given number. 
However, if I subtract 47 by 37, I get 10, which doesn't fit with the remaining 51.
Combining 41 - 37 = 4, and then 47 - 4 = 43, and considering 43 as 51 - 7, but 7 isn't a given number.
Next, I notice that 51 - 41 = 10, and 10 is close to 47, so I have to add some magic to make it 47.
If I add 10 to 37, I get 47. 
So the equation is 51 - 41 + 37 = 47.
</think>
<answer> 51 - 41 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 16, and 54 that equals 37. Let's start by looking at the operations we have - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
I notice that subtraction could be useful here: 75 - 54 = 21, which brings us closer to 37. 
Now, adding 16 would give us 21 + 16 = 37, which is exactly what we want.
So the equation using the numbers 75, 16, and 54 to get 37 is: 75 - 54 + 16 = 37.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 54 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 47, 31, and 54 with basic arithmetic operations, we should consider how subtraction and addition can help us reach the target number.
First, let's attempt to use subtraction to bring the numbers closer to 38:
- If we subtract 31 from 47, we get 16. Now our numbers are 16, 54, and 38.
- Next, we see that 54 - 16 = 38. This gives us the target number.
So the equation we get is 54 - 47 + 31 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 54 - 47 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 64, 57, and 37 that equals 44. Looking at these numbers, I notice that 64 - 57 = 7. If I use 7 and the number 37, I can use them in a way to get to 44. Adding 37 to 7 gives me 44. Therefore, the equation would be 64 - 57 + 37 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 64 - 57 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 52, 51, and 36. We need to use these only once each and combine them to get 67.
Looking at these numbers, we notice that 52 - 36 = 16. So we have used 36 and 52 now.
We need to get from 16 to 67. If we add 51 (the number left), we get 16 + 51 = 67.
Therefore, the equation is 52 - 36 + 51 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 36 + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the given numbers 44, 61, 3, 31 to make the equation equal to 45. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 31 is closer to 45 than to 44 or 61, so it might be a good candidate for subtraction to get me near 45.
If 31 is subtracted from 61, I get 29. Now I need to reach 6 from 29 to reach 45. If I add 44 to 29, I get 73, which is too much. However, if I subtract 44 from 31, I get -13, which is also not correct.
Next, I consider 31 + 44 = 75. This is too much again, so I try breaking this into parts by subtracting 44 from 61, as in 61 - 44 = 17. Now I need 28 more to get to 45. Since 31 - 3 = 28, I can use 31 - 3 to add up to 28.
So the equation becomes (61 - 44) + (31 - 3) which simplifies to 17 + 28 = 45.
</think>
<answer> (61 - 44) + (31 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the given numbers (1, 84, 14, 13) using basic arithmetic operations to reach 82. Notice that 84 might work well with subtraction or division, as it's a large number.
Let's start by trying to use 84. If we subtract 14 from 84, we get 70. Now we need 12 more to reach 82, since 70 + 12 = 82.
Next, we can use the number 13 from our set to reach 12, by performing 13 - 1.
So the equation becomes: 84 - 14 + 13 - 1 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 14 + 13 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 57, 69, and 71. We need to use each exactly once and combine them to get to 83.
One way to approach this is to consider if any of the numbers can combine to make a closer value to 83, and then if there's an arithmetic operation that can result in 83.
71 is closest to 83 (71 + 12 = 83), and since we need to add 12, we can note that 69 - 57 = 12.
So the equation is 71 + (69 - 57) which equals 83.
</think>
<answer> 71 + (69 - 57) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 82, 70, and 78 exactly once to equal 90. I'll start by checking if any straightforward addition or subtraction will work:
82 + 70 = 152 (too high)
78 + 70 = 148 (too high)
82 + 78 = 160 (too high)
78 + 70 - 82 = 66 (too low)
I notice that 82 is quite close to 90, so I'll try to find a way to increase the result without exceeding 90. 
82 + 78 - 70 = 90
This gives us 90 exactly, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer>82 + 78 - 70</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 82, 70, and 78 to get 90 using basic arithmetic operations. 
- Notice that 90 is close to 82 and 78, which are both greater than 80.
- If we subtract 70 from 82, we get 12. 
- Then, adding 12 to 78 gives us 90.
So, the equation would be: 82 - 70 + 78 = 90.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 70) + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 39, 60, and 67 to create an equation that equals 88. If I look at the numbers, I see that 67 - 39 = 28, which is close but not right. I need to get 60 towards 88. If I add 60 to 28, I get 88, which is what I need. So the equation is 67 - 39 + 60 = 88.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 39) + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 49, 96, and 67 to get 20. Looking at the numbers, 96 - 49 = 47. This is closer to 20, but I need to get it to 20 and I have 67 left. If I take 67 - 47, that leaves me 20. So, the equation would be 67 - (96 - 49) = 20.
</think>
<answer> 67 - (96 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 49, 60, 34, and 92. We need to create an equation that equals 69. One approach is to see if we can get close to 69 using one or two numbers and then adjust with the others.
If we look closely at the numbers, subtracting 49 from 92 gives us 43. Now, we need to get from 43 to 69. We can achieve this by adding 26. Now, we need to see if we can make 26 using 60 and 34.
We can do this by subtracting 34 from 60, which gives us 26. Therefore, we can combine these parts to make our equation: (60 - 34) + (92 - 49) = 26 + 43 = 69.
</think>
<answer>(60 - 34) + (92 - 49)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 3, 5, 85, and 3 to create an equation that equals 74. Let's try different combinations of the numbers and operations.
One possible way to get to 74 is: 
85 - 5 - 3 = 77
Then, we can use the remaining number 3 to subtract from 77 to get 74.
So, the calculation would be: 85 - 5 - 3 - 3 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 85 - 5 - 3 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 3, 5, 85, and 3 to get the result 74. Observing the numbers, 85 seems to be significantly larger than the rest, which points towards subtraction or division. However, 85 - 3 also doesn't give 74. Similarly, 85 / 3 does not result in an integer. Now looking closer, I realize I should consider multiplication or addition alongside it.
3 * 3 = 9 is a small number. If we add this to 5, we get 9 + 5 = 14. Now, 85 - 14 = 71, which is very close to 74. All we need to do is adjust this slightly. 
Considering these combinations, I can see that 85 - 14 = 71, and if I reduce 71 by 7 to get 74, it will work. But 7 cannot be formed using 3, 5, or 3 again. So, let's consider how 7 can be equally achieved using the numbers we have.
5 - 3 = 2, and 2 * 3 = 6, and then 85 - 6 = 79, which is very close. Adding -1 to 79 (not using this number) to reach 74, I realize an error as I'm still not achieving the result in the given constraints. 
However, I see that 85 - (5 + 3) = 77, and if we consider 77 - 3 = 74, this checks out. Using 5 + 3 = 8, and 85 - 8 = 77, and then 77 - 3 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 85 - (5 + 3) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 3, 95, and 33 exactly once to make 59. 
- Looking at the numbers, I can see that 95 - 33 = 62, which is far from 59.
- If I subtract 3 from 95, I get 92, which is close but too high.
- If I subtract 33 from 95, I get 62, which is very close to 59.
- To get from 62 to 59, I need to subtract 3 from 62.
- That means using 95 - 33 - 3 = 59.
</think>
<answer>95 - 33 - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 70, 35, and 2 exactly once to get the result of 33. 
Let's start by considering what happens when we divide 70 by 2. This gives us 35.
Now we have the numbers 35 and 35. Subtracting 35 from 35 gives us 0.
Thus, the equation is: 70 / 2 - 35 = 35 - 35 = 0.
We need an extra 33, so we need to find a way to add 33 to 0. Since we can't directly add 33, let's reconsider the original numbers and operations.
If we take 70 and subtract 35, we get 35, but to get to 33, we need to further modify this result.
Considering the equation one more time, 70 - 35 = 35, and to reach 33, we can use 2 directly: 35 - (70 - 35) = 35 - 35 = 0.
To correct this, we can adjust the equation: (70 - 35) + 2 = 35 + 2 = 37.
To get to 33, we need to subtract 4 from 37, but that's not possible with the numbers given. Instead, let's try another arrangement.
Taking 70 - 35 = 35, if we subtract 2 from 35, we get 33: 35 - 2 = 33.
This fits our requirement. Therefore, the equation is 70 - 35 - 2 = 33.
</think>
<answer> (70 - 35) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that equals 67 using the numbers 29, 81, and 43 exactly once. Let's start by looking at the differences and sums of these numbers.
- The difference between 81 and 43 is 38.
- Now, if I subtract 38 from 29, I get -9, which isn't helpful.
- Let's try adding the difference (81 - 29 = 52) to 43. This gives us 95, which is close but not 67.
- The next thought is to try subtracting 43 from 81, which gives 38.
- If I subtract 9 (29 - 43) from 38, I get 29.
- This doesn't seem to be leading anywhere useful. 
- Let's try another approach: subtract 43 from 81 to get 38, and then add 29 to get 67.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 43) + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 29, 81, and 43 exactly once to get 67 as the result. Let's consider basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If I subtract 43 from 81, I get 38. Now I need to get 30 more to reach 67 (38 + 30 = 68). But since I can only use each number once, I remember that I can use 29 which is the other number left. 
By adding 29 to 38, I get exactly 67. 
So the equation is 81 - 43 + 29 = 67. </think>
<answer> 81 - 43 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 78, 16, and 83 to create an equation that equals 21. 
Looking at these numbers, I notice that 78 - 83 = -5, which is not 21.
If I use 83 - 78 = 5, I can then try to make 21 from 5 and 16 using addition or subtraction.
5 + 16 = 21, this works!
So, the equation combining the numbers is 83 - 78 + 16 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 78 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 19, 10, and 67. We need to use each one exactly once to make 38 using basic arithmetic operations.
Considering the target number 38, we should look at how the other numbers relate to it. 67 and 19 are quite far from 38 while 10 is a closer value.
Let's see if we can use 10 as part of our equation. If we subtract 10 from 67, we get 57. Now, we need to get from 57 to 38. We can do this by subtracting 19 from 57, which gives us 38.
So the equation would be (67 - 10) - 19 = 38.
</think>
<answer>(67 - 10) - 19</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using 12, 3, and 19 that equals 28. Let's start by considering the operations and numbers at our disposal.
- Multiplying 12 by 2 gives 24, which is close to 28.
- Adding 19 to 4 would give 23, which is closer but too low.
- Adding 4 to 28 (which is essentially 12 + 3) gives 31, which is too high.
Instead, let's take 19 and add it to 12 to get 31, and then subtract 3 to get 28.
</think>
<answer> (19 + 12) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 94, 65, and 45 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 16. If I look at the numbers, 45 is a bit large and 94 and 65 are quite further from 16. The number 45 seems to be a possible candidate to round down or use it in some operation.
Let's consider subtracting: 94 - 65 = 29. This is not 16, but it's close. If we consider 94 - 65 + 45, we get 94 - 65 = 29, and then 29 + 45 = 74, which is far from 16.
Now, let's think about division and subtraction: 94 / 65 = 1.4545, which is not an integer and not 16. Using 94 / 65 - 45 = -43. 23 doesn't work either.
Considering 65 + 45 = 110 and subtracting 94 gives 110 - 94 = 16. This works, using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer>65 + 45 - 94</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target: we need to reach 50 using the numbers 4, 57, and 11 once each with basic arithmetic operations.
- One useful observation is that 57 is relatively large, so subtracting it from other numbers might not get us closer to 50 easily.
- 4 and 11 can give us 15 if we add them together, which might be helpful.
- Now, if we subtract 15 from 57, we get 42, which is far from 50.
- Instead, if we divide 57 by 11, we get approximately 5. 18, which isn't an exact whole number, so it won't work directly.
- However, if we divide 57 by 11, we can think of how we might subtract it from 57 to get closer to 50.
- So, let's consider 57 - 4 = 53.
- If we subtract this result from 50, we're looking for 50 - 53, but that doesn't help as it gives a negative result.
- Instead, if we consider 57 - (11 / 4), we get approximately 57 - 2. 75, which is close to 54. 25.
- This doesn't seem to simplify easily, but considering 57 - 11 = 46, and then multiplying by 4/10 (though 10 wasn't explicitly given, we need to find a way to use 4 to get 50),
- Considering 57 - 11 = 46, now we need to add 4 or subtract a fraction involving 4 to reach 50.
- By directly subtracting 11 from 57, we get 46. Then, adding 4 to this result gives us 50.
</think>
<answer> 57 - 11 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 55, 96, and 61 exactly once to get 90. Looking at these numbers, 96 and 61 are quite far from 90, so we should try to get close to 90 from these two and then adjust with 55.
96 - 61 = 35
Now we have 35 and 55. We need to get to 90, so we can add 55 to 35 to get 90.
The calculation is 96 - 61 + 55 = 90.
</think>
<answer> (96 - 61) + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers given: 69, 73, and 80. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 84 using basic arithmetic operations.
69 + 73 would give us 142, which is too high.
If we try subtracting, 80 - 69 equals 11, and then 11 + 73 equals 84, which is what we wanted.
So the equation should be: 80 - 69 + 73 = 84.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 69 + 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using 54, 4, and 20 that equals 70. I should consider all operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I notice if I subtract 4 from 54, I get 50. Then, if I add 20 to that result, I get 70.
So the equation would be: (54 - 4) + 20 = 70.
</think>
<answer>(54 - 4) + 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 11, 13, and 74 exactly once, and equals 50. Looking at the numbers, we can see that 74 is quite large and 11 and 13 are smaller. One possible way to reach 50 might involve subtraction or division to reduce the larger number.
- Let's try subtracting 11 and 13 from 74: 74 - 11 - 13 = 50.
- This equation uses all three numbers exactly once and results in 50.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 11 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 65, 27, and 18. We need to create an equation that equals 20 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 65 - 27 = 38, which is close to our target of 20. We can use this subtraction to our advantage.
If we now divide 38 by 18, we will not get 20, but we can adjust by considering addition or subtraction of 8 (which is 27 - 19, but 19 is not in our set).
Let's see if 65 - (27 + 18) or 65 - (27 - 18) will work. 
Calculating:
65 - (27 + 18) = 65 - 45 = 20
This indeed gives us 20, using all numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 65 - (27 + 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 65, 27, and 18 using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 20. The number 18 is the smallest and can be used as a primary operand for subtraction or addition.
Let's start by subtracting 18 from 65, which leaves us with 47.
Next, we need to consider how to get from 47 to 20 using the remaining number 27. If we subtract 27 from 47, we get 20.
So the equation would be: 65 - 18 - 27 = 20.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 18 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 45, 68, and 44. We need to form an equation that equals 69 using these numbers only once. 
We can start considering how we might combine these numbers with basic arithmetic operations. One possibility could be using subtraction to reduce 68 to a more manageable number and then add another number.
If we subtract 44 from 68, we get 24. Now, we need to add 45 to this result to reach 69.
So the equation would be: 68 - 44 + 45.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 44 + 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 50, 57, and 53 exactly once to get 46. Let's start by considering the operations we can use. If we think about subtraction and addition, 57 - 53 = 4, which is close to 46, but we're 42 short. If we take 50 and add 4, we get 54, which overshoots our target. Subtracting 4 from 50 gives us 46, which is exactly what we need. </think>
<answer> 50 - (57 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 92 using the numbers 70, 75, and 53 exactly once. I'll start by considering adding or subtracting these numbers and then see if I can use multiplication or division to get to 92.
75 + 53 = 128
128 - 70 = 58
58 is not equal to 92, so let me try subtracting 75 instead of adding it:
75 - 53 = 22
Now I have two numbers, 22 and 70. If I add 70 to 22, I get:
22 + 70 = 92
This gives me the result I want, using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 53 + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 28 using the numbers 33, 7, and 2 exactly once. 
I notice that 33 is close to 28, so I can consider subtracting 33 by a smaller number to get closer to 28.
28 - 33 = -5, which isn't what we want, but if I add 5 using another number, then that could work.
The smallest positive number available is 7. So, I can use 33 - 7 + 2 = 28.
</think>
<answer> (33 - 7) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 7, and 2 that equals 28. Let's start by considering what kind of operations might work well with these numbers. Adding or subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to lead us to 28. Multiplying or dividing 33 or 7 doesn't get us close to 28 either. However, if I subtract 2 from 33 and then divide the result by 7, I might get closer to 28.
33 - 2 = 31
Next I divide 31 by 7:
31 / 7 = 4.42857...
This isn't 28, but it's a bit less than 28. To make it the right amount, I can subtract a smaller number from 31. Since 31 - 3 = 28, I can use 31 (from 33 - 2) and subtract 3. However, since 3 is not one of the remaining numbers, I need to rethink this.
Given the numbers are 33, 7, and 2, another possible combination is to use all three numbers together. If I use division, subtraction, and addition in a more intricate way, I can reach the target. Let's consider:
33 - 7 + 2 = 28
This uses each number only once and follows the order of operations correctly (subtraction before addition).
</think>
<answer> 33 - 7 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 45, 57, and 46 using basic arithmetic operations so that they equal 56. One way to approach this is to add or subtract combinations of these numbers and then use the result to reach 56.
- Notice that 57 - 46 = 11.
- Now I have the numbers 45, 11, and 46.
- Adding 45 and 11 gives 56.
So the equation can be (57 - 46) + 45 = 56.
</think>
<answer>(57 - 46) + 45</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 57, and 46 that equals 56, using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 57 - 46 = 11. This is a step in the right direction, but I need to reach 56.
Then, I realize if I add 45 to 11 I will get 56. So the equation becomes:
57 - 46 + 45 = 56
</think>
<answer> 57 - 46 + 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 4, 40, and 27. We need to use each number exactly once and employ basic arithmetic operations to reach the result of 52.
A useful step is to check if any of the numbers can be combined to give us an easier value to work with. Notice that 40 - 27 = 13. Now we have 13 and 4. 
Next, we need 52, and we currently have 13 and 4. Adding 38 seems to be necessary, but 38 is not directly obtainable using these numbers. 
Let's reconsider and see if we can use the operations in a different way:
(40 - 27) + 4 = 13 + 4 = 17, which is not 52.
We need to think about how we can form 35 from the remaining numbers. Instead of taking 40 - 27 we could think about breaking it up differently:
(40 - 4) + 27 = 36 + 27 = 63, which is close but over.
Finally, let's try this:
(40 - 27) * 4 = 13 * 4 = 52, which equals 52.
So the equation is 13 * 4.
</think>
<answer>(40 - 27) * 4</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 31, and 36. We need to use each exactly once to generate an equation that equals 81.
Looking at the numbers, we can observe that 76 + 36 gives us 112, which is close to 81.
Then, if we subtract 31 from 112, we get:
112 - 31 = 81
This forms the equation:
(76 + 36) - 31 = 81
</think>
<answer>(76 + 36) - 31</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 20, and 60. We want to form an equation that equals 41. 
One approach is to use the largest number (60) and then find a way to reduce it to get close to 41. Subtracting 20 from 60 would give us 40, which is very close to 41. 
Then, we just need to add 1 to get the final result of 41. Therefore, the equation can be (60 - 20) + 1.
</think>
<answer>(60 - 20) + 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 96, 63, and 46 that equals 79. Let's start by looking at the possible combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
96 + 63 + 46 = 205 (which is too high)
96 - 63 - 46 = -13 (which is too low)
96 * 63 / 46 = 135.17 (which is not an integer and not 79)
96 / 63 + 46 = 5.85 (which is not 79)
Then let's try 63 - 46 + 96 = 13 + 96 = 109 (which is too high)
63 + 96 - 46 = 162 (which is too high)
63 * 46 / 96 = 28.44 (which is not an integer and not 79)
46 * 63 / 96 = 30.78 (which is not an integer and not 79)
Finally, 96 - 46 + 63 = 50 + 63 = 113 (which is too high)
But 96 + 46 - 63 = 142 - 63 = 79, which is correct.
</think>
<answer> 96 + 46 - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 13, 31, 51, and 54 that equals 15. I should look for a combination of basic arithmetic operations that can achieve this.
Looking at the numbers, I notice that 54 - 51 equals 3. If I can get 12 using 13 and 31, then I can subtract 54 - 12 to get 15.
Seeing that 13 - 31 gives me -18, which is far from what I need, I turn my attention to adding numbers. 
13 + 31 equals 44, which is too large.
Now, let's try 31 - 13 = 18. Not helpful.
Adding 13 + 51 gives me 64, which is also not right.
Considering the possibility of fraction or multiplication:
54 / 31 gives a value slightly greater than 1. But, division by 13 or 51 would not yield 12.
Multiplying 13 * 31 just doesn't help in constructing 12.
Now, the key insight: If I take 51 - 31 = 20, and then subtract 54 - 20 = 34, which is incorrect.
Instead, look at 54 - 31 = 23, then 13 + 23 = 36 and clearly this is incorrect.
Taking a new approach, perhaps 51 - (31 - 13) = 33, which is again incorrect.
However, 51 - (31 - 13) is essentially 51 - 18 = 33. Moving on, 31 - (13 - 31) = 51 - 18 = 33.
Close, the correct expression should be 51 - 31 = 20 and then 13 - 20 = -7, which doesn't help.
Reflecting, 31 - 13 = 18, and then 51 - 18 = 33. This is leading nowhere.
54 - (31 - 13) because 31 - 13 = 18 and 54 - 18 = 36 still doesn't work.
Finally, 51 - (31 - 13) = 51 - 18 = 33, closer to 15.
So, 51 - (54 - (31 - 13)) = 15
</think>
<answer> 51 - (54 - (31 - 13)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 97, 95, and 79. We need to use each of these once and we can use basic arithmetic operations to get 77.
- If we start with subtraction, we notice that 97 - 95 = 2.
- If we subtract 2 from 79, we get 79 - 2 = 77.
This gives us the equation: 79 - (97 - 95) = 77.
</think>
<answer> 79 - (97 - 95) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 58, 13, 13, and 40. We need to create an equation that equals 18. One approach is to try to use subtraction or division to get closer to 18.
- We can use 58 - 40 = 18, but we only have one 58 and one 40.
- We could look at the other numbers (13 and 13) and see if combining them in any way with what we already have can help.
- If we can use addition or multiplication with these remaining 13s and 13s, we might be able to get close.
- Consider 13 + 13 = 26, but that's too large. Maybe we need to subtract 26 - 40, but we only have one 40.
- Let's try another combination: 40 + 13 + 13 - 58:
  - 40 + 13 = 53
  - 53 + 13 = 66
  - 66 - 58 = 8, which isn't close to 18.
- Now let's try a different approach: 58 - (13 + 13) + 40
  - 13 + 13 = 26
  - 58 - 26 = 32
  - 32 + 40 = 72, which is too large.
- Given that none of the above combinations seem to work, let's try another strategy: (58 + 13 - 40) - 13
  - 58 + 13 = 71
  - 71 - 40 = 31
  - 31 - 13 = 18, which gives us our desired result.
</think>
<answer>(58 + 13 - 40) - 13</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 74, 49, and 31. We need to find a way to use these numbers and basic arithmetic operations to get 56.
We can try to combine the numbers in such a way that subtraction or addition gives us 56 with one of the numbers. Noticing that 74 - 49 = 25 and then we need to get from 56 to 25 using 31, and 74 - 25 = 49, it seems we are close.
If we do 74 - 49 = 25, we get the intermediate value 25. Now, we need to use 31 to reach 56. We can try 56 - 31 = 25, which is indeed the value we have.
So, the equation would be 74 - 49 + 31 = 56.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 49 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and their potential combinations. One useful strategy is to start with a subtraction to see if it can lead me to the number 28. If 50 - 29 equals 21, then I would need 7 more to get to 28. Then I would see if I can make 7 from the remaining numbers 47 and 40. 47 - 40 equals 7, so I think I might have found a solution. I'll check the order: 50 - 29 + 47 - 40.
</think>
<answer> 50 - 29 + 47 - 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 68, 13, and 34. We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 47. One way to approach this is by subtracting or dividing to reduce the numbers.
Checking subtraction first: We can look at subtracting 13 from 68 which gives us 55. Then, subtracting 34 from 55 gives us 21, still not 47.
Now, let's check if dividing or combining these operations can help us reach 47. If we take 68 - 34, we get 34. Dividing 34 by 13 gives us 2.615, which is not 47.
We need to find another combination. How about starting with 68 and then maybe subtracting or dividing 34 or 13. Trying 68 - 34 - 13 = 11, which is still less than 47.
We need to increase the result. Multiplying or adding 13 or 34 to the current result. If we try 13 * 34, we get 442 which is too large. Subtracting 13 from 442 gives 430 which is also not 47.
Let's try a different combination: 68 - 34 = 34, then 34 + 13 = 47.
This seems to work. So, the equation is 68 - 34 + 13 = 47.
</think>
<answer> (68 - 34) + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 13, and 34. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- We can start by trying to subtract or add small numbers to see if we get close to 47.
- If we try 68 - 34 = 34, which is far from 47.
- Now let's try combining 68 and 13: 68 + 13 = 81, which is too high.
- If we try 68 - 13 = 55, we get a number closer, but we still need to use 34 and hit 47.
- Considering multiplication and division: 68 * 13 / 34 = 26.857, which isn't an integer and is not equal to 47.
- Now, let's try 68 - 34 + 13: 68 - 34 = 34, then 34 + 13 = 47.
So, the equation that uses 68, 13, and 34 exactly once to get 47 is 68 - 34 + 13.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 34 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers given: 26, 23, 81, and 16. We need to use these numbers once each to make the equation equal to 94.
We need to consider different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we add 81 and 16, we get 97, which is close to 94. We need to reduce this by 3 to get 94.
26 - 23 = 3
So, we can use these values: (81 + 16) - (26 - 23) = 94
</think>
<answer>(81 + 16) - (26 - 23)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers available: 66, 23, and 62. We need to use these numbers exactly once along with basic arithmetic operations to get 27.
We can start with subtraction: 66 - 23 = 43, which is close to 27, but too high. Now, let's try 66 - 62 = 4, and then we need 23 - 4 = 19 to reach 27. This doesn't work as we end up with a different number.
Next, let's try addition and subtraction: 23 + 62 = 85, which is much too high. Let's try instead 66 + (62 - 23): 
66 + (62 - 23) = 66 + 39 = 105, which is also incorrect.
Given these attempts, another combination might be 66 - 23 = 43, and then 43 - 16 (but 16 is not directly available, so let's see if there's another possibility).
Instead of 66 - 23, let's try using division: 66 / 2 = 33, which is too high, so let's try 66 / 2 = 33 and then 23 - 11 (11 = 33 / 3), giving us a closer intermediate step.
We observe: 66 / 2 = 33 and 33 / 3 = 11, then 23 - 11 = 12, but this doesn't give us 27.
The accurate approach is:
Considering 23 - 62 + 66 = 27.
</think>
<answer> 23 - 62 + 66 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 66, 23, 62. We need to create an equation that equals 27 using each number exactly once.
If we look at the possible operations, multiplication and subtraction are more promising since they can help us reduce the larger numbers to a more manageable size.
If we subtract 62 from 66, we get 4. Now we need 23 + 4 = 27, but we don't have 23 yet. We use 23 which is already present. So the equation can be put together as 66 - 62 + 23 = 27.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 62 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 70 using the numbers 38, 33, 64, and 11 exactly once. 
Starting with 64 + 11 = 75, which is close to 70 but slightly over. We can then subtract 33 from 75, but we need to get to exactly 70. So 75 - 33 = 42, which is not 70.
Now, instead of subtracting, let's consider if we can make 64 - 33 = 31 and then use the remaining numbers to get to 70. 31 + 38 = 69, not exactly 70. 
Since this doesn't work, let's try another approach: if we can make 38 - 11 = 27, we could then use 64 + 33 = 97, and then 97 - 27 = 70.
Checking, 38 - 11 = 27, and 64 + 33 = 97. Now we have 97 - 27 = 70, which works.
</think>
<answer> (64 + 33) - (38 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 38, 33, 64, and 11. We need to arrange these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 70.
We can start by seeing if we can make a combination that uses addition and subtraction effectively. 
Multiplying 38 by 2 would give us 76, which is close to 70, but we can't use 2 because we only have 33, 64, and 11.
If we subtract 6 from 38, we get 32. Now if we add 33 to it, we get 65. That's pretty close but still 10 more than 70.
Now, if we take 11 from 64, we get 53. This makes 65 - 11 = 54.
So, 54 + 16 = 70.
Since 16 is the same as 38 - 22, and knowing 22 can be formed from 33 - 11, the equation can be written as follows:
(38 - (33 - 11)) + (64 - 11) = 70
We can simplify this to: 38 - 33 + 11 + 64 - 11 = 70
Now, combining like terms: (38 + 11 + 64) - (33 + 11) = 113 - 44 = 70.
But again, there's a simpler way to express it using addition and subtraction directly: (64 + 11) - (38 - 33) = 70.
Thus, the equation becomes: 64 + 11 - (38 - 33) = 70
</think>
<answer> 64 + 11 - (38 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 93, 45, and 64 that results in 46. I'll start by looking at how the numbers can be combined with basic operations to get close to 46.
One way to approach this is by subtracting numbers to get closer to 46, and then using addition or subtraction to reach exactly 46.
Let's see: 93 - 66 = 27. Now if we add 19 to 27, we get 46.
19 can be derived from 45 - 26, but 26 is not in our list. Let's use the other number, 64 - 64, which is equivalent to subtracting 0 and brings no change.
So our equation could be: (93 - 66) + (64 - 26) = 46.
However, 26 is not in the given list, so we need to reconsider. 45 - 21 would work, but 21 is not provided.
Actually, if we see again, we can subtract 45 - 19 where 19 is 64 - 45. This works because:
93 - 66 = 27
27 + (64 - 45) = 27 + 19 = 46
Therefore, the equation is 93 - 66 + 64 - 45 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 66 + 64 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 84, 94, and 31. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 41.
One approach would be to see if we can use subtraction or division to get closer to 41. Notice that 94 - 84 = 10, which is a large leap away from 41. Similarly, 84 / 2 = 42, which is also far from 41.
Now if we consider a combination of addition and subtraction:
If we take 94 and subtract 31, we get 63. Then if we subtract another smaller number (84) from 63, we might approach 41:
94 - 31 - 84 = 63 - 84 = -21
This is not 41.
However, let's revisit by reversing the subtraction:
This time, using the numbers in a different order:
94 - 84 + 31 = 10 + 31 = 41
So we have come up with the equation: 94 - 84 + 31 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 84 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 70, 49, and 49 to get an equation that equals 70. One way to approach this is to look for a combination where subtraction or addition of these numbers can lead to 70.
One possible combination could be: 70 - 49 + 49.
Let's check this:
70 - 49 + 49 = 21 + 49 = 70
So, this combination works.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 49 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 15, 57, and 30 to get 72. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One approach is to use the larger number 57 more directly, since it's the closest to 72. If I subtract 15 from 57, I get 42. Now I need 30 more to reach 72. I can acheive this by adding 30 to 42.
So the equation should be: (57 - 15) + 30 = 72.
</think>
<answer>(57 - 15) + 30</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 97, 23, and 56. We need to create an equation that equals 64 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Looking at the numbers, 97 and 23 seem to be the only ones that can potentially be used in such a way. If we try subtracting the smaller number from the larger one, we get 97 - 23 = 74, which is not 64.
Next, let's try 97 - (56 - 23). This simplifies to 97 - 33 = 64. This looks promising as it uses all three numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer>(97 - (56 - 23))</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 97, 23, and 56 that equals 64. Let's start by checking if any number can be subtracted from or added to another to get 64. If not, we might need to use multiplication or division.
- 97 - 23 = 74, which is too high.
- 97 - 56 = 41, which is also too high.
- 97 + 23 = 120, which is too high.
- 97 + 56 = 153, which is far too high.
Let's try using the numbers in multiplication or division:
- 23 * 56 / 97: This gives approximately 13. 2, which is far from 64.
- 56 / 23 * 97: This calculation would be 56 / 23 = 2. 43, then 2. 43 * 97 = 237. 01, which also doesn't match 64.
Now let's check if we can use division and subtraction in a creative way:
- (97 - 56) - 23: This simplifies to 41 - 23 = 18, which is still not 64.
It seems that the given numbers and basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) don't easily fit to produce exactly 64. But, we should not overlook anything. Let's try another combination:
- 97 - 56 - 23: This simplifies to 41 - 23 = 18, which still isn't 64.
Given the constraints, it looks like there might be an error or oversight in the initial numbers or operations. However, we can still try another combinatory approach to see if we can get closer to 64:
- 97 - 56 + 23: This gives 41 + 23 = 64, which is the solution.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 56 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 71, and 30 that equals 98. Let's start by seeing if there's a combination that involves addition or subtraction that gets us closer.
If I subtract 30 from 71, I get 41. Now I have 57 and 41.
Adding 57 and 41 gives me 98, which is the target number. So the equation becomes 57 + 71 - 30 = 98.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 71 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 38, 64, and 30 to get 72. One approach is to see if any of the numbers can be used as they are, or if they need to be manipulated through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Looking at the numbers:
- Adding 38 and 30 gives 68, which is close to 72, but not quite there.
- Subtracting 30 from 64 gives 34, which brings us closer.
- Now, adding 38 to the result (34) gets us closer: 38 + 34 = 72.
This means we can use the equation 38 + (64 - 30) which equals 72.
</think>
<answer> 38 + (64 - 30) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 40, 48, 46, and 44 exactly once to get 86. Let's try combining them with basic operations.
First, I notice that 48 + 44 = 92, which is close to 86. If I subtract something from 92, I might hit 86. 
Next, let's see if 46 - 40 = 6. Indeed it does. Now, to go from 92 to 86, we need to subtract 6. And that's exactly what 46 - 40 does.
So, the equation is 48 + 44 - (46 - 40).
</think>
<answer> 48 + 44 - (46 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 87, 21, and 94. We need an equation that equals 14 using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We'll start by looking at the smaller numbers, 21 and 94, which are relatively close to 14. Adding or subtracting small integers from 94 could bring us close, but we can't use 94 again. 
Considering the differences, 94 - 21 = 73, which is too large. Let's try subtraction of 21 from 87, which gives us:
87 - 21 = 66
This is still far from 14. So, let's think of combining or manipulating these numbers differently.
94 - 87 = 7, and now we need 7 more to get to 14. 
21 - 7 = 14
This seems like the solution. We need to incorporate 7 into our equation. As we used 21 - 7 = 14, the original 7 needs to come from 94 - 87 = 7.
Thus, we can use the equation: 21 - (94 - 87) = 14.
</think>
<answer> 21 - (94 - 87) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 18, 18, and 71. We need to use these in some combination of arithmetic operations to get to 35.
18 + 18 equals 36, which is close to 35. If we subtract 1 from 36, we get exactly 35. 
Subtracting 1 from 36 can be accomplished by using 71 - 18 - 18.
So the equation will be (71 - 18 - 18).
</think>
<answer>(71 - 18 - 18)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the given numbers: 28, 4, and 1. We need to create an equation using these numbers that equals 25. 
- We can try to use subtraction and addition. The difference between 28 and 4 gives us 24. If we then add 1 to 24, we get 25.
- This gives us the equation: 28 - 4 + 1 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 28 - 4 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 28, 4, and 1. We need to use these numbers exactly once and then apply basic arithmetic operations to get 25.
We can try combining 28 and 4 in different ways and then use 1 to reach 25. One possible combination is:
28 - 4 = 24
Now we need 1 more to make it 25.
24 + 1 = 25
This works! So the equation is 28 - 4 + 1.
</think>
<answer> 28 - 4 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 42, 31, and 12. We need to create an equation that results in 61 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try to combine the numbers in such a way that we can get closer to 61. Let's try adding 42 to 31. This gives us 73, which is too high.
Now let's try adding 12 to 31, which gives us 43. If we then subtract 12 from this result, we get \( 43 - 12 = 31 \), which isn't 61.
However, if we try subtracting 12 from 43, we get \( 43 - 12 = 31 \), which if we then add 31 to it gives us 62, which is close but not exactly 61.
Next, let's try subtracting 31 from 42, which gives us 11. If we then add 12 to this result, we get \( 11 + 12 = 23 \), which isn't 61 either.
Let's try subtracting 42 from 31, which gives a negative number and isn't helpful here.
Instead, let's try a different combination: \( 42 - 31 = 11 \). Now if we add 12 to 11, we get \( 11 + 12 = 23 \), which still isn't 61.
Finally, let's try adding 12 to 31 and then subtracting 42, resulting in \( 31 + 12 - 42 = 13 - 42 = -29 \). This isn't correct either.
Given the constraints of using each number exactly once, let's try subtracting 12 from 42 first: \( 42 - 12 = 30 \). Then, adding 31 to 30 gives \( 30 + 31 = 61 \).
</think>
<answer> (42 - 12) + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 23, and 51. We need to use each number exactly once to create an equation that equals 73. 
We can start by trying to combine the numbers in a way that might make the result approach 73. 
Looking at the numbers, we can see that 51 + 23 = 74, which is very close to 73. If we need to get to 73, we can then subtract 1 from 74.
Therefore, the equation is 51 + 23 - 1 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 23 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 1, 23, and 51 to get 73. Let's start by adding the largest number, 51, to the next largest, 23, which gives us 74. Now we need to get from 74 to 73. If we subtract 1 from 74, we will achieve our goal. So the equation will be 51 + 23 - 1 = 73.
</think>
<answer>51 + 23 - 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 49, 73, and 34. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 88.
One approach is to look for a combination that might give us the right results.
If we try 73 - 34, we get 39. Now we need 49 + 39 to reach 88. This gives us the equation:
73 - 34 + 49 = 88
</think>
<answer> 73 - 34 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to think of how the numbers 71, 20, and 57 can be combined using basic arithmetic operations to equal 34. Looking at the numbers, it seems that 71 and 57 are far away from each other, while 20 is closer in value to 34. 
If I subtract 57 from 71, I get 14. Now I need another number that, when added to 14, gives me 34. To achieve this, I need 20 because 14 + 20 = 34.
So the equation is 71 - 57 + 20 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 57 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 99, 42, 3, and 78 that equals 60. Let's look at the numbers available. One approach is to see if we can combine them in a way that one of the numbers works as a difference from another.
If we subtract 3 from 78, we get 75. Then if we subtract 42 from this result, we get 33. Finally, if we add 99 to 33, we get 132. This doesn't work.
Another possibility is to see if there's a combination of the numbers when added or subtracted that will result in 60 directly. If we subtract 3 from 33 (which is 30), and add 42 to this, we get 30 + 42 = 72. That's not 60 either.
Now, let's try subtracting 42 from 78, which gives us 36. Adding 99 to 36 results in 135, which isn't 60.
Finally, consider if we can use a combination: If we subtract 42 from 99, we get 57. Then if we subtract 36 from this result, we get 57 - 36 = 21, and finally if we subtract 21 from 60, we should get zero. This doesn't work either.
There is a combination I haven't tried yet: if we subtract 3 from 42, we get 39, and then if we add 99 to 39, we get 138. That's still not 60.
Now let's try 99 + 3 = 102, then subtract 42 and 39 from 102 to reach 60: 102 - 42 - 39. This equals 21, which isn't 60.
After thorough examination, it appears that creating the equation directly using the numbers and operations provided is not as straightforward. However, a known equation utilizing the given numbers and the operations is: (99 - 78) + 42 - 3 = 60.
</think>
<answer>(99 - 78) + 42 - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 90, 98, 33, and 68 to get 87. I'll start by examining how these numbers can be combined with basic operations.
98 - 90 = 8
Adding 68 - 33 = 35 doesn't help directly, but I can try different combinations.
Another look at the numbers suggests combining 98 and 33 first, as:
98 + 33 = 131
Then subtract 90 + 68 = 158:
131 - 158 = -27
This doesn't work. However, trying another combination of operations like:
(98 - 90) + (68 - 33) = 8 + 35 = 43
This is still not correct. 
Instead, I consider:
(98 - 68) + (90 - 33) = 30 + 57 = 87
This gives the correct sum of 87.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 68) + (90 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 40, and 8. We want to use these numbers to get a result of 56 using basic arithmetic operations. 
One way to approach this is to consider multiplication or addition that can yield close to 56. Notice that 40 * 1. 4 = 56, so we need to achieve 1. 4 using 2 and 8. 
Since 8 / 2 = 4, we can get 1. 4 from 4 * 0. 35. But we need 0. 35, and we don't have that directly from 2 and 8. 
However, let's try a different combination: 8 - 2 = 6, and then 40 / 6 gets us close to 6. 67. 
Multiplying or dividing from here doesn't give us an exact 56, but if we add these results, we can get closer. However, it seems like we might be unable to reach exactly 56 without using each number only once in a specific combination. Let's try another approach by combining the numbers differently.
8 * (40 / 2) = 8 * 20 = 160, which is too big.
Then, let's try: 40 + (8 - 2) = 40 + 6 = 46, which is still not 56.
Upon further inspection, it seems we missed one important combination: (8 * 2) + 40 = 16 + 40 = 56.
</think>
<answer>(8 * 2) + 40</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 90, 6, and 85 exactly once to equal 30. Considering basic arithmetic operations, if I divide 90 by 6, I get 15. Then, if I subtract 85 from 15, I get -70, which isn't our target. However, if I reverse the order and subtract 85 from 90, I get 5. Now, if I multiply this result by 6, I get 30, which is exactly what we need.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 85) * 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 56, 9, and 63 which equals 63. Looking at the numbers, 63 is one of the numbers given, so I can start with that and then look to combine the other two in a useful way.
Considering the operations we can use, if I subtract 9 from 63, I get 54. Now, 56 is very close to 54. If I then subtract 56 from 54, I get -2, which isn't helpful. However, if I add 56 to 54, I get 114, which is not 63 either.
Considering another approach, I notice that 63 - 56 = 7, and 7 * 9 = 63.
So the equation we can use is (63 - 56) * 9 = 63.
</think>
<answer>(63 - 56) * 9</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations that can help us get to 88 using the numbers 39, 68, and 19. 
Multiplying 68 by 1.5 would result in 102, which is close to 88 and uses all three numbers. However, 1.5 is not an integer, so this seems infeasible.
Next, I'll try taking 19 away from 68 and then adding 39. This gives me 68 - 19 + 39 = 88.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 19 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We need to form an equation using the numbers 18, 81, and 70 that results in 29.
Looking at the numbers, we might notice that 81 - 70 = 11, which is close to 29. If we can manipulate it further, we might reach our desired result.
Now, if we take the difference of 81 - 70 = 11 and add 18 to it, we get: 11 + 18 = 29.
So, the equation becomes: (81 - 70) + 18 = 29.
</think>
<answer>(81 - 70) + 18</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 18, 81, 70. These are the digits we can use. We need to create an equation that equals 29 using all these numbers only once.
One effective approach might be to look for numbers that can be combined to get close to 29. Notice that 81 is quite large, and 70 is also quite large. 18 can be a useful anchor point since it's a smaller number.
If we subtract 70 from 81, we get 11. Then, we need to get from 11 to 29. 29 - 11 = 18, which exactly matches our remaining number. Hence, the equation becomes:
81 - (70 - 18) = 29
</think>
<answer> 81 - (70 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 18, 81, and 70 using basic arithmetic operations that results in 29. Let's start by considering the possibility of using subtraction and addition.
18 + 70 = 88, which is far from 29. 
Now let's consider 81 - (something).
A difference of 52 would bring us closer to 29 (81 - 52 = 29).
Checking the numbers left, 18 + 70 = 88 also seems too high.
Considering just 81 - 18 = 63 is also too high.
Now, if we see 81 - 70 = 11, we will need to subtract more to get to 29. So let's see if (81 - 70) - 18 = 3 as a subtraction would lead us closer. 81 - 70 - 18 = 3 is not 29.
However, 81 - 70 + 18 = 29, which works.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 70 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 76 using the numbers 8, 45, 60, 53. Adding or subtracting the largest numbers seems promising.
8 + 60 = 68, which is pretty close to 76. Now, I need to get 8 more to make it 76.
Since 76 - 68 = 8, I can use 45 - 53 to get -8. Thus, combining 68 with -8 gives 76.
So the equation is: (8 + 60) - (45 - 53) = 76.
</think>
<answer> (8 + 60) - (45 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 14, 7, and 12. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to make the equation equal 19.
Let's try combining 14 and 7. If we subtract 7 from 14, we get 7.
Then we have 7 + 12, which equals 19.
So the equation is 14 - 7 + 12 = 19.
</think>
<answer> 14 - 7 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 7, and 12 that equals 19. Let's start by considering how I might combine these numbers. One approach is to see if I can subtract one number from another and then add the remaining number. If I subtract 7 from 14, I get 7. Then I just need to add 12 to get to 19. So, 14 - 7 + 12 = 19.
</think>
<answer> 14 - 7 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 14, 7, and 12. We need to use these exactly once to make 19 using basic arithmetic operations. 
We can start by trying to see how we can combine the numbers first. If we subtract 7 from 14, we get 7. Now we need to combine 7 and 12 to make 19.
Adding 12 to 7 gives us 19. So the equation is: 14 - 7 + 12 = 19.
</think>
<answer> 14 - 7 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 82, 24, and 21 exactly once to get 79. 
I see that 82 is quite a bit larger than 79, so I might want to subtract or divide to get closer to 79. 
If I subtract 24 from 82, I get 58. 
Now I have 58 and 21, and 58 - 21 = 37, which is still not 79.
Let's try multiplication and addition: 21 * 24 = 504, which is too large.
Instead, let's try a subtraction and addition: 82 - 24 = 58, then 58 + 21 = 79.
This gives us the equation 82 - 24 + 21 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 24 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 47, 36, and 51. We need to create an equation that equals 40 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try some combinations:
- 47 - 36 = 11 which is not what we want.
- 47 + 36 = 83 which is too large.
- 51 - 36 = 15 which is not helping us close to 40.
- 51 - 47 = 4 which is a small step, but we still need 36 to make it 40.
- What if we use 36 - 51? That's -15, not good.
- What if we try adding the two remaining numbers (47 + 51) and then subtracting 36: (47 + 51) - 36 = 98 - 36 = 62, still not 40.
- Let's try another approach: 51 - 47 = 4 and then if we can use 36 correctly, 36 / 4 = 9. But we need 40, so this doesn't work.
- Then 51 + 36 = 87 and 47 is too large to make it right.
- What if we do 47 - 51 = -4 and then use 36 / 4 = 9, again not right.
- 51 - (36 / 47) - 36 = 51 - 8.18 - 36 = 9.82, which is also not 40.
- Perhaps rearranging the operations could work better: (51 + 36) - 47 = 87 - 47 = 40.
</think>
<answer> (51 + 36) - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 5, 7, and 49. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to equal 14.
- If we look at 49, it's a large number, so it might not be useful in a simple equation.
- We can try combining 5 and 7 in some way. If we add 5 and 7, we get 12.
- To reach 14 from 12, adding 2 would work. But we need to use only the numbers 5, 7, and 49.
- Since 2 is not available, let's consider if there's another combination we're missing.
- Now, let's consider 49 - 7 = 42. This is still not 14.
- Let's try 49 - 5*7. We can calculate this: 5*7 = 35, so 49 - 35 = 14.
So the equation 49 - 5*7 = 14 is valid using each number only once.
</think>
<answer>49 - 5*7</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 69, 77, 50, and 72 exactly once to get a result of 30. One way to approach this is to consider if there are any combinations of the numbers that when combined using basic arithmetic operations result in 30.
Looking at the numbers, a promising calculation could involve subtracting or adding numbers to get closer to 30. If I subtract 69 from 77, I get 7. Adding 50 gives 57. Now if I add 27 (which could be the remaining 72 minus 45 to make 27), I get 84. This seems to be getting us far from 30.
Instead, let's try another approach. With 72 and 50 being relatively large, we might want to consider smaller values. Subtracting 50 from 72 gives 22. If I subtract 22 from 77, I get 55. Now if I subtract 55 from 69, I get -9, which is far from 30.
However if I reorder the steps using 72 - 50 = 22, then 77 - 22 = 55, and 69 - 55 = 14, we're not there yet.
But if I look at 72 + 50 = 122, this is too large. With 122 - 92 (which is 82 - 40) gives us 82, which is not 30.
Let's try another combination: (77 - 50) * (72 / 50). That would be 27 * 1. 44 which gives 39. 08.
Given how the numbers are working out, it seems 72 + 50 - 69 - 77 does not work. Finally, I have the insight that (77 - 50) - (72 / 69) does not give 30. However, if I consider (72 - 50) + 77 - 69, it simplifies step by step as 22 + 77 - 69 = 22 + 77 - 69 = 30. 
So finally we check out: (72 - 50) + 77 - 69 = 22 + 77 - 69 = 30.
</think>
<answer> (72 - 50) + 77 - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 69, 77, 50, and 72 exactly once to get 30. Let's look at the numbers and see if there's a combination that works.
I notice that 72 - 50 = 22, which is close to 30. If we can somehow get to 8 from the other numbers, we might have a solution.
Then, 77 - 69 = 8, which is exactly what we need.
Therefore, the equation can be (77 - 69) + (72 - 50) = 8 + 22 = 30.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 69) + (72 - 50) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 76, and 15 that equals 94. Let's try different combinations and operations.
- Adding 33 and 76 gives us 109. Subtracting 15 from 109 gives us 94. So, this seems promising.
- The equation would be 33 + 76 - 15 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 33 + 76 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 28, 47, and 3 to result in 72. One way to approach this could be to see if multiplication or addition can bridge the gap. Looking at the numbers, multiplying 28 by 3 gives me 84, which is close but too high. On the other hand, if I subtract the smallest number 3 from 28, I get 25. Now I have 25 and 47. Adding these together gives me 72. So, the equation seems to be 28 - 3 + 47 = 72.
</think>
<answer> (28 - 3) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 92, 43, and 8. To get to 41, I should try to combine these numbers in a way that fits. 
I notice that 92 - 43 = 49, which is close to 41, but too high. 
If I subtract 8 from 49, I get 41. That seems to be exactly what we need. 
So, the equation is: 92 - 43 - 8 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 43 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 87, 7, and 26 that results in 68. Looking at the numbers, we can use subtraction and addition.
One approach could be to use 87 - 26 and then add 7 to it. This gives us:
87 - 26 = 61
61 + 7 = 68
So, the equation would be (87 - 26) + 7.
</think>
<answer> (87 - 26) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 87, 7, and 26 exactly once. Let's try to manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
If I add 26 and 7, I get 33. Now if I subtract this sum from 87, I get 87 - 33 = 54. This is still not 68.
However, if I consider the equation in a different way, and I subtract 26 from 87 and then add 7, I get 87 - 26 + 7, which simplifies to 61 + 7 = 68.
So, the equation is 87 - 26 + 7.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 26 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 18, 54, and 80 exactly once, resulting in 44. 
Let's start by considering the largest number, 54. If we subtract 18 from 54, we get 36. Now, we need to get from 36 to 10 more to reach 44. 
Looking at the remaining number 80, we see that 80 - 36 = 44, which is exactly what we need.
Thus, the equation is 80 - (54 - 18).
</think>
<answer> 80 - (54 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 6, 21, and 14 to make 29. Looking at the numbers, 21 - 6 = 15. Now I have 15 and 14 left. If I add 14 to 15, I get 29. So the equation should be 21 - 6 + 14 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 21 - 6 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 32, 80, and 27. We need to create an equation that equals 21 using each number exactly once. 
We notice that 80 - 32 = 48, which is a large number. Subtracting 27 from 48 might give us closer to 21, so let's try (80 - 32) - 27.
(80 - 32) - 27 = 48 - 27 = 21.
So, the equation is (80 - 32) - 27 = 21.
</think>
<answer>(80 - 32) - 27</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all possible combinations of the numbers 9, 53, 69, and 21 using basic arithmetic operations. I need to achieve a result of 28. 
I notice that 69 - 53 = 16, which is not what I want.
Then, 53 - 69 + 21 = -5 + 21 = 16, which is still not it.
But, 69 - 53 - 9 = 16 - 9 = 7, which is not correct.
I then try: 69 - 53 + 9 - 21 = 16 - 21 = -5, which is not the solution.
Next, I try: (69 - 53) - 9 + 21 = 16 - 9 + 21 = 7 + 21 = 28.
This appears to be the correct combination. So, the equation is (69 - 53) - 9 + 21 = 28.
</think>
<answer> (69 - 53) - 9 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 34, 62, and 60 that equals 36. Each number can only be used once and basic arithmetic operations are allowed.
Let's try different combinations using these numbers:
- Starting with subtraction: 62 - 34 = 28, which is close but not 36.
- Adding 60 to a difference: (62 - 34) + 60 = 28 + 60 = 88, not 36.
- What if we add and subtract differently: 62 + 34 - 60 = 96 - 60 = 36, this works!
So, the equation is 62 + 34 - 60 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 62 + 34 - 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 82, 90, and 63 that equals 71. Let's start by looking at what we can do with these numbers.
We can see that 90 - 82 = 8. Now we need to use 63 and the number 8 to get to 71.
Adding 63 and 8 gives us 71.
So the equation formed is 63 + (90 - 82).
</think>
<answer> 63 + (90 - 82) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 82, 90, and 63. We need to use each number only once and combine them using arithmetic operations to get 71.
Let's try some combinations:
82 - 90 = -8
-8 + 63 = 55 (not 71)
82 - 63 = 19
19 + 52 = 71 (but 52 is not in our list)
82 - 52 = 30
30 + 41 = 71 (but 41 is not in our list)
Let's try another approach:
90 - 82 = 8
8 + 63 = 71
This works! So, the equation is 90 - 82 + 63 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 82 + 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 91, 41, and 10. We need to create an equation that equals 40 using these numbers only once each. 
- Adding or subtracting 91 and 41 gives 132, which is too large. Subtracting 41 from 91 gives 50, which is close but not 40.
- Now, subtracting 10 from 50 (as 50 is derived from 91 - 41) equals 40.
So, the equation is 91 - 41 - 10 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 41 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 45, and 25 that equals 10. I should explore combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using each number only once.
If I take 45 - 30, I get 15. Then, if I divide 15 by 25, I get 0.6. This doesn't equal 10.
Considering another combination, I see if 25 + 30 equals 55, and then dividing 55 by 5 (which is 45 - 40 but 40 isn't in the list) doesn't work. I should focus on simpler combinations.
Now, let's try 45 - (30 - 25). This simplifies to 45 - 5, which equals 40. Clearly, this is too large.
Let's remove the larger number and try 30 - (45 - 25). This simplifies to 30 - 10, which equals 20. That's still off.
I've gone through these combinations and they are not yielding 10. This might mean the straightforward arithmetic operations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division alone won't work with the numbers provided. But I'll double-check the possibility.
Let's try 45 / 4.5. 45 / 4. 5 = 10. But 4. 5 is not one of the original numbers.
Since we've exhausted the straightforward combinations, I'll consider the possibility that we need to multiply or divide the numbers in a way that the result equals 10. If I take (30 * 45) / 25, I get 540 / 25, which isn't 10.
Finally, let me try 30 - 45 + 25. This simplifies to -15 + 25, which equals 10.
</think>
<answer> 30 - 45 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 48, 51, and 13. We need to create an equation that equals 86 using basic arithmetic operations and each number only once.
We can start by looking at the large numbers and see if we can get close to 86. Adding 48 and 51 gives us 99, which is close to 86 but a bit too high. Subtracting 13 from 99 gives us 86. Therefore, 99 - 13 = 86.
So the equation is 51 + 48 - 13 = 86.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 48 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 79, 64, and 40 just once each to make 55. Looking at the numbers, 79 - 64 = 15 seems like a possible start. Then, if I can combine 15 and 40 to make 55, I'm done. Adding 15 and 40 gives me 55 exactly. So the equation would be 79 - 64 + 40 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 64 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 9, 1, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 19. 
We can start by considering adding and subtracting these numbers. If we add 9 and 11, we get 20, which is close to 19. To get to 19, we need to subtract 1 from 20. 
So the equation would be: (9 + 11) - 1 = 19.
</think>
<answer>(9 + 11) - 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 25, 89, and 35 which equals 79. Let's start by looking at the numbers and how we can use arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to start with a larger number and then subtract or add smaller numbers to reach 79.
If I look at 89, it is the largest number. If I subtract 35 from 89, I get 54, which is closer to 79 than using 25. Now I need to subtract 14 more to reach 79, which I can do with 25 since 54 - 25 = 29. But 29 is still not 79, so I need to add 50 more to reach 79, which again can be done with 25 since 29 + 25 = 79.
So the equation is 89 - 35 + 25 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 35 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers and see how we can use them to reach 60. We have 3, 39, 8, and 94 available.
- 94 minus 39 gives us 55.
- Now we have 3, 8, and 55 left. 
- Adding 8 to 55 gives us 63, which is close to 60 but a bit higher.
- If we subtract 3 from 63, we get exactly 60.
Therefore, the equation is 63 - 3 = 60.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 39) + 8 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 64, 9, and 26. We need to form an equation with these numbers using basic arithmetic operations that results in 29.
If we try to subtract 9 and 26 from 64, we get:
64 - 9 - 26 = 29
This operation uses all three numbers exactly once and follows the given conditions.
</think>
<answer> 64 - 9 - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 1, 12, and 81. We need to create an equation that equals 68 using these numbers exactly once. We can start by looking at the larger number, 81, because it's close to 68. We can use subtraction to get closer to 68: 81 - 12 = 69. Now, we need to get to 68 from 69, which means we need to subtract 1 from 69. We can achieve this by using the number 1 as it is. So, 69 - 1 = 68. This gives us the equation: 81 - 12 - 1 = 68.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 12 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 43, 59, 85, and 38. We need to use each exactly once to get the result of 55 using basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers directly doesn't seem to work since the sum and difference of these numbers are far from 55.
- Multiplication and division also seem less promising when using each number only once.
- Let's check if combining numbers and using operations can yield 55.
- If we try to add some numbers and then subtract the remainder, we can check:
  - 85 + 38 = 123
  - Now we need to get from 123 to 55 by using the remaining numbers 43 and 59.
  - 123 - 43 = 80
  - Now we need to get from 80 to 55 by using the remaining 59.
  - 80 - 59 = 21, which is not what we need.
- Now, let's try another combination: 59 + 38 = 97
- Then we have 97 - 85 = 12
- Finally we need to get from 12 to 55 by using the remaining 43.
- 12 + 43 = 55, which works.
</think>
<answer> 59 + 38 - 85 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to come up with an equation using the numbers 53, 81, 7, and 7 that equals 28. Looking at the numbers, it seems that 81 and 53 combined could be the base to subtract from, as 81 - 53 = 28. However, we still need to use 7 and 7 in the equation. The only way is to use the 7s in the equation. If I subtract 7 from 81, I get 74, and then if I subtract 53 from that, I'm left with 21. That's close but not quite 28. If I try subtracting 7 from 53, I'm left with 46. Now, if I use that 7 from the remaining 7, subtracting it from 46 gives me 45. Then, from 46, if I subtract 5 (which is 46 - 41), I get 28. However, I used 41 twice, which is incorrect. The correct way to use the 7s to get 28 from 53 and 81 is by doing: (81 - 53) - (7 - 7) = 28. </think>
<answer> (81 - 53) - (7 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 48, 34, and 89 that equals 75. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 89 - 48 = 41, which is close to what I need. If I take 41 and add 34, I get 75. So the equation would be 89 - 48 + 34 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 48 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 38, 84, and 53 exactly once, with the result being 69. 
Consider the numbers available: 38, 84, and 53. 
Notice that 84 - 38 = 46. 
If I subtract 53 from this difference: 46 - 53 = -9, this doesn't help because it's not 69.
Let's try another approach: 
84 - 38 + 53 = 99 - 30 = 69.
This works because 84 - 38 equals 46, and adding 53 to that gives 99. Subtracting 30 (which is 53 - 23, and we don't have 23, but we can check by reversing operations to see if smaller numbers work). The reverse of 53 + 30 = 83, and 84 - 83 = 1. So I need to adjust by subtracting 23 initially which we can retrieve by using 84 - (38 + 53).
84 - 38 - 53 = 46 - 53 = -7. And 46 - 53 + 69 = 69.
Adjusting for simplicity directly, 84 - 53 - 38 = 31 - 38 = -7, add 92 (84 + 53 - 38) = 69 (adjusting to 92 - 23), but that doesn't make sense directly. So recalibrate and use directly: 84 - 53 = 31, then 31 + 38 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 53 + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 46, 31, 7, and 86 exactly once to get the result 16. One useful observation is that 86 minus 31 gives 55, which is quite close to 16 but in the wrong direction. If I use 55 minus 46, I get 9, which also isn't 16.
Another clue is that 7 is close to 86, so trying 86 minus 7 gives 79, which is again not 16.
Now, considering 46 plus 7 equals 53. If I use 46 plus 7 and then subtract 31, I get (46 + 7) - 31 = 22 - 31 = -9. That's still not 16.
Finally, trying 46 minus (86 minus 7) gives 46 - 79 = -33. 
However, another possibility emerges when I rearrange: 86 - (46 + 7) which equals 86 - 53 = 33. This isn't 16 either.
Another route is to use 86 - 46 which is 40, and then apply the inverse operation with 31: 40 - 31 = 9.
Further calculations with these can lead us to use 31 - 7 = 24 and then subtract 46: 24 - 46 = -22. 
None of the combinations so far hit 16. But let's try 86 - (46 + 7) again but in another configuration: (86 - 46) - 7 = 40 - 7 = 33 again.
Let’s try 46 + 7 - 86 = 53 - 86 = -33.
I tried different factorizations and logical operations, but the result was not 16. I will now use 86 - 46 = 40 and then subtract 7 and 31: 40 - 7 - 31 = 33 - 31 = +2.
None of these combinations resolved to 16. Finally, rechecking the initial options, the correct configuration can be found: 86 - 31 - 7 = 53 - 7 = 46 - 29 = 17. Clearly, these still didn't lead to 16.
The solution should be derived by combining the numbers in another way. However, reviewing the sources and realizing my initial assumptions did not dissuade the pattern of 86 - 7 + 31 (rather than simply 86 - 46):
Ultimately the correct way is to use 86 - 46 + 7 - 31 = 17 + 7 - 31 = 14. 
This shows that the initial numbers had to be manipulated differently, and the final correct equation is 86 - 46 + 7 - 31 = 16.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 46 + 7 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 74 using the numbers 11, 3, and 88. Looking at these numbers, it seems adding 88 to 11 gives me 99, which is quite close to 74, but a bit too high. If I subtract 3 from 99, I'll get 96, still too high. 
If I use the numbers in this order, I should try another combination. Subtracting 88 - 11 = 77, which is still not 74. 
If I try 88 + 11 - 3, I will get 96, which is more than 74. 
Now, let's try another combination: (88 - 11) - 3 = 74. This seems to give me the answer I need.

<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 39, 40, and 44 exactly once to result in 43. I notice that 44 - 39 = 5, which is close to 43. If I subtract or add 40 to/from 5, I can reach 43. Since 40 can only be used once, subtracting 40 from 5 would give me -39, not 43, so that's not the right direction. However, adding 40 to 5 gives me 45, so instead, I should subtract 40 from 44 - 39. This results in 44 - 39 - 40 + 43. But that's incorrect because we're only allowed to use each number once.
Another way to look at it is to increase 39 by a small number to approach 43 and then use 40. If I add 4 to 39, I get 43. Afterwards, I use 40, which brings me to 43 - 40 + 43. But that also doesn't use all the numbers.
After several trials, I saw that 44 - 40 equals 4. Then, we can then add 39 to 4 to get 43. Combining these gives us: 44 - 40 + 39 = 43.
</think>
<answer> 44 - 40 + 39 </answer>

<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 51, 87, and 52 that equals 88. I'll start by looking at the given numbers and trying different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Adding and subtracting these numbers in various orders doesn't seem to yield 88.
- Multiplying the numbers or any part of them doesn't get me close to 88 either.
- If I divide 87 by 51, I get approximately 1. 72, which is not helpful.
- Now, let's try 87 - 51 = 36, and then add 52: 36 + 52 = 88.
So, the equation that uses all three numbers exactly once and equals 88 is 87 - 51 + 52.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 51 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 36, 17, and 36 exactly once to get 55. Adding 36 and 17 gives 53. So, I need to get 2 more to reach 55. The number 36 can be used as part of the equation to achieve this.
36 + 36 - 17 = 55
This equation uses all numbers exactly once, and it evaluates to 55.
</think>
<answer> 36 + 36 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 94, 98, and 49. We need to use each number exactly once to get the result of 53 using basic arithmetic operations.
- 98 and 49 are quite large numbers, and 94 is a smaller number. 
- If we subtract 94 from 98, we get 4, which doesn't lead us to 53.
- If we subtract 49 from 98, we get 49, and then if we subtract 94, we would need to find a way to make 94 - 49 - 94 = 0, which isn't possible with these numbers.
- Consider multiplying 98 and 49 and then subtracting 94: This gives us a big number, but we need to adjust it to 53.
- Instead, let's try using the numbers as follows: 98 - 94 + 49. This gives us 98 - 94 = 4, and 4 + 49 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 94 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 15, 36, and 29 exactly once to get 80. I can start by trying to see if any combinations of these numbers, combined with basic arithmetic operations, will give 80.
I notice that 36 + 29 = 65, which is close to 80. If I can somehow make 15 work with these, it might do the trick.
Considering division and subtraction, 36 - 15 = 21. Now if I take this result 21 and add it to 29, I get 21 + 29 = 50. This is still not 80, but if I add 36 instead of subtracting 15, I get 36 + 29 = 65.
Since 80 - 65 = 15, I can put the pieces together: 36 + 29 + 15 = 80.
</think>
<answer> 36 + 29 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 80 using the numbers 15, 36, and 29. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
I notice that 36 + 29 = 65 is close to 80. If I can make this equation work, I just need to finish with an addition that will get to 80.
36 + 29 = 65
Now, I need to do 80 - 65 = 15.
So, I can use the addition of 15 to reach the target number.
65 + 15 = 80
To finish, I can use the 15 from the original number.
This gives us the equation: (36 + 29) + 15 = 80.
</think>
<answer>(36 + 29) + 15</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 87, 51, and 19 exactly once to equal 55. Looking at the numbers, 87 - 51 = 36 seems quite large and doesn't leave much room for adjustment. If I subtract 51 from 87, I get 36. Now, 87 - 51 is more than 55, so instead of adding, I'll need to subtract or add something. 
Concatenating 51 and 19 to get 5119 would be difficult, so I might use division or addition. If I subtract 19 from 51, I get 32. Now, if I add 87 to 32, I get 124, which is too much. 
Instead, let's take 51 - 19 = 32. Then, we need 55 - 32 = 23. To get 23, we could use another number, but using 87 would be too much as well. 87 - 64 would be 23, but 64 isn't in our set. If we take 51 - 19 = 32, and then 87 - 32, we get 55. This works!
So the equation is: 87 - (51 - 19) = 55.
</think>
<answer> 87 - (51 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to create the number 44 using the numbers 40, 5, 21, and 22 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Looking at the numbers, 22 is very close to 44 if we add 22 to 21. So, let's add 22 and 21 first: 22 + 21 = 43.
Now we have 40 and 5 left. We can get 44 by adding 40 and 5: 40 + 5 = 45.
However, we need to get exactly 44, so we'll subtract 1 from 45. We can create 1 using 22 - 21 = 1.
So, combining these steps, the equation is 40 + 5 - (22 - 21) = 44.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 5 - (22 - 21) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and the target result. We need to use 48, 27, and 64 exactly once to get to 85.
We see that 64 is very close to 85, so we might think about subtracting or adding the other numbers from 64 or to see if we can get to 85 by adding or subtracting 48 and 27.
Subtracting 48 from 64 gives us 16, which is not 85, and adding 27 to 16 gives us 43, which is too low.
Adding 48 to 27 gives us 75, which is still far from 85, so we need something more to reach 85.
Let's consider an alternative; perhaps we can use division, but numbers don't typically yield neat whole number results out of division.
Now, let's try a combination:
64 - 27 = 37
Then we add 48, which gives:
37 + 48 = 85
Thus, we have successfully reached our target number 85 using the numbers 64, 27, and 48.
</think>
<answer> 64 - 27 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 48, 27, and 64 that can produce 85 when combined using basic arithmetic operations. One effective way to approach this is to start by seeing if I can combine 48 and 27 in one operation, as these are the smallest numbers, and then possibly add 64 to reach 85.
If I subtract 27 from 48, I get 21. Now, I need 64 to reach 85, which means I need 85 - 64 = 21. Since 21 is already the result of the subtraction 48 - 27, I can simply add 64 to this result to get 85.
(48 - 27) + 64 = 85.
</think>
<answer>(48 - 27) + 64</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 63, 70, and 35. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to get a result of 98.
Let's look at the second number, 70, as it is close to 98. If we subtract 35 from 70, we get 35. Then combining 35 with 63 should give us 98.
So, the equation would be: 70 - 35 + 63 = 98.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 35 + 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 36, 6, and 54 exactly once to get the result of 60.
Considering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, I should check different combinations.
If I add 36 and 54, I get 90 which is too high.
If I subtract 54 from 36, I get -18 which is not helpful here.
Multiplying 36 and 6 gives 216, which is too high.
Dividing 36 by 6 gives 6, which is small, but useful.
So, I can add this result (6) to 54 to make 60.
With these considerations, I can formulate the equation as 54 + (36 / 6) = 60.
</think>
<answer> 54 + (36 / 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 52, 45, and 43 that equals 36. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing these numbers.
Let's consider: (52 - 43) - 45. This gives us 9 - 45, which equals -36, not 36.
Another combination could be: (52 - 45) - 43. This simplifies to 7 - 43, which equals -36, again not 36.
We need to use all numbers, so let's try a combination that includes the division operation to fit the target of 36.
How about: (52 - 43) / 45? This gives us 9 / 45, which simplifies to 1/5, not 36.
Now, let's try: 45 - (52 - 43). This simplifies to 45 - 9, which is 36. This works.
</think>
<answer> 45 - (52 - 43) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 13, 12, and 42 using basic arithmetic operations to get 67. 
- If I add 42 and 12, I get 54. 
- Then, if I add 13 to 54, I get 67. 
So the equation would be 42 + 12 + 13 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 42 + 12 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 11, 3, and 1 exactly once to equal 32. 
I notice that 11 is the largest number, so it might be helpful to use this as the base of an addition or multiplication problem.
Multiplying 11 by 3 gives 33, which is very close to 32, and if I subtract 1 from 33, I get exactly 32.
So the equation would be 11 * 3 - 1.
</think>
<answer> 11 * 3 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 11, 3, and 1 that equals 32. Let's start by considering what we can do with these numbers.
- If we add 11 and 3, we get 14. This is not close to 32, so let's try other combinations.
- Adding 14 and 1 gives us 15, still far from 32.
- Instead, let's multiply 11 by 3. This gives us 33, which is very close to 32. Now we just need to subtract 1 from 33 to get to 32.
So the equation becomes: (11 * 3) - 1 = 32.
</think>
<answer>(11 * 3) - 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 17, 67, and 61. We need to form an equation that equals 11 using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
The number 61 seems to be a bit large and far from 11. The number 17 is close to 11, and 67 is significantly greater than 11.
Let's try 17 - 61 + 1. However, 61 - 17 does not equal 11 (44). So, this is not correct.
Now, let's try 67 - 17 - 61. This does not equal 11 either (10).
Since no straightforward subtraction seems to work, let's consider multiplication or division. 67 * 17 / 61 appears complicated because 17*67 = 1139, which is even further from 11.
Let's reconsider 17 + 61 - 67, which simplifies to 78 - 67 = 11.
This gives us the equation: 17 + 61 - 67 = 11.
</think>
<answer> 17 + 61 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 15, 37, and 16 that equals 38. Let's analyze the numbers and operations.
- The number 16 is close to 38, so subtracting or dividing may not be the best approach as it could make the result too small.
- Adding 16 to 15 gives 31, which is still far from 38.
- Considering multiplication of 15 and 37 gives 555, which is way too large.
- If I add 16 and 37, I get 53, which is getting closer, but still too large.
- Subtracting 15 from 37 gives 22, which, when added to 16, gets me close: 16 + 22 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 16 + (37 - 15) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out our numbers: 93, 68, and 93. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 67.
Let's try operations involving 93 and 68:
93 - 68 = 25
This doesn't work since we still need to include the other 93.
Now let's try another approach:
(93 + 68) / 93
This gives us 161 / 93 = 1.738 which is not 67.
Another idea:
(93 + 68 - 93) = 68
Also didn't work. It seems that combining numbers directly does not yield 67. We need to try rearranging or combining the number in a different way.
Considering we need to use 93 or 68 directly and see if combining them in a different manner or a different operation gives us 67.
Well, (93 - 68) / 93 = 25/93 which is not 67.
93 / 68 + 93 = 1.368 + 93, which also doesn't give us 67.
Another approach that comes to mind is:
68 * (93 - 93) = 68 * 0 = 0
Indeed, none of the steps satisfies 67. However, since 68 - 93/93 = 68 - 1 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 93/93 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 14, 25, and 83. We need to use these once each to make 94 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can try to see if we can combine 25 and 83 in a way that results in a number close to 70, since we would need 24 more to reach 94.
25 + 83 = 108
This is close, let's see if we can adjust it.
108 - 14 = 94
This combination works, using subtraction to get from 108 to 94 by subtracting 14.
So, our equation is 108 - 14 = 94.
However, let's express this using the original numbers provided: 25 + 83 - 14 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 25 + 83 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 14, 25, and 83. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get a result of 94 using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider the sum of 25 and 83 which is 25 + 83 = 108. To get to 94 from 108, we can subtract 14.
So, the equation becomes: 25 + 83 - 14 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 25 + 83 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 7, 5, and 89 exactly once to equal 91. We can start by looking at the numbers: 89 is very close to 91, so we might think of subtracting 89 and then adding the remaining value.
Let's calculate: 91 - 89 = 2. Now, we need 2 more to reach 91, and we have 7 and 5 left. Adding 7 and 5 gives us 12, which is too much.
Instead, we should consider multiplication or division with these numbers. If we multiply 7 and 5, we get 35, and then add 55 (obtained by adding 7 to 89 and then subtracting 89) would give us 91. However, we only have 5, so that doesn't work.
Considering adding 7 and 5 first and then subtracting 89 won't give us the right result either.
Instead, let's try another approach: 89 - 5 + 7. This gives us 89 - 5 = 84, and then 84 + 7 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 5 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 48, 56, and 21. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, and the result should be 29.
- We can start by trying combinations of addition and subtraction:
  - 56 + 21 - 48 = 29
  - This gives us the result of 29, so we have found the correct equation.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 21 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 48, 56, and 21 that equals 29. Looking at the numbers, it seems subtraction might be the way to go because 48 - 56 ≠ 21, 56 - 48 ≠ 21, and 21 - 48 and 21 - 56 won't work since they would give negative results or numbers smaller than 21.
Let's try 56 - 48 + 21. 56 - 48 = 8, and then 8 + 21 = 29. This gives us the result we want.
</think>
<answer> 56 - 48 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 48, 56, and 21. We need to create an equation that equals 29 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try to subtract or add numbers to reach 29.
If we subtract 21 from 56, we get 35. Then, to get to 29 from 35 by using the last number 48, we would need to perform 35 - 48 + x = 29.
However, since such a straightforward operation doesn't exist, let's consider multiplying or dividing.
Multiplying 56 by 21 gives a very large number (1176), which is too big. Dividing 56 by 21 also doesn't simplify easily.
Now, let's consider 56 - 48 = 8, and then consider 21 - 8 = 13, far away from our target of 29.
A more promising path is to add 48 + 56 - 21. If I do this, I get:
48 + 56 = 104
Then, 104 - 21 = 83.
This is not right either.
Given the constraints, let's try reordering. If we take 56 - 21, which gives 35, and now subtract 48 from that:
56 - 21 = 35
35 - 48 = -13
No luck there.
Let's look at 21 + 48 = 69, then subtract 56:
21 + 48 = 69
69 - 56 = 13
Still not 29.
Another trial is to take 48 + 21 = 69, then subtract 56:
48 + 21 = 69
69 - 56 = 13
This is incorrect too.
Given the problems with trial and error, perhaps a different combination will cover all entries in our set without introducing negative values:
1. Start with 56
2. Add 21: 56 + 21 = 77
3. Subtract 48: 77 - 48 = 29
</think>
<answer> 56 + 21 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers and operations to see if any immediate combinations will work. We need to get to 49 using 55, 20, and 26 with each used only once. 
55 - 26 = 29
This gives us 29, which is close but not right. Next, I'll consider operations with 20.
If I take 20 from 29, I get 9. Now, I need to get from 9 to 49 using 55. 
55 + 9 = 64
This gives us exactly 49. So the equation now is 55 - 26 + 20 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 55 - 26 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 67, 20, and 68 exactly once to equal 21. 
The number 21 is close to 67 - 68, so I can use subtraction. 
If I subtract 68 from 67, I get -1. But we need a positive 21. 
Then adding 20 might get us closer. So, let's check this: 67 - 68 + 20 = -1 + 20 = 19.
This is not 21, and we exhausted all possibilities with subtraction so far.
Now, let’s try 68 - 67 + 20. This gives us 68 - 67 + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21.
This seems right, and it meets all the conditions (numbers used only once, and equals 21). </think>
<answer> 68 - 67 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 29, and 72 that equals 31. One way to start is to look at the operations that might help me reduce the larger numbers to 31. If I subtract 72 from 74, I get 2. Then, if I add 29 to 2, I get 31. So the equation using these steps would be: 74 - 72 + 29 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 72 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 16, 29, and 58 exactly once with arithmetic operations to get 13. 
Looking at the numbers, 58 is the largest and could be manipulated in a way that helps us reach 13. 
Subtracting 45 from 58 leaves us with 13 (58 - 45 = 13).
Now, we need to create 45 using the remaining numbers 16 and 29. 
We can achieve this by adding 29 and 16 (29 + 16 = 45).
So, the equation will be 58 - (29 + 16).
</think>
<answer> 58 - (29 + 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 29, and 58. We need to create an equation that equals 13 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We see that 58 - 29 = 29. Now, we need 29 - another number to get 13. This would mean 29 - 16 = 13.
So the equation is 58 - 29 - 16 = 13.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 29 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 9, 69, and 12. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 72.
One way to approach this is to consider what can be combined or manipulated to reach 72.
69 is a bit tricky, but 69 - 9 = 60. Now we need to get from 60 to 12 more to reach 72. Adding 12 to 60 would do the trick.
So the equation would be: 69 - 9 + 12 = 72.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 9 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 71, 5, and 26 that equals 40. I'll start by looking at the numbers and considering possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
71 + 5 + 26 = 102 which is too high.
71 + 26 - 5 = 92 which is also too high.
71 - 5 + 26 = 92 which is still too high.
Now, let's try another combination:
(71 - 26) + 5 = 45 which is too high.
Finally, let's try:
71 - (26 + 5) = 71 - 31 = 40
This gives us the correct result of 40.
</think>
<answer> 71 - (26 + 5) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 29, 32, and 3. We need to get a result of 64. Looking at the numbers, 32 and 31 (which can be formed by 32 - 3) are close to 64, so let's try to use them. If we add 3 to 32, we reach 35. Now, we need an additional 29 to reach 64 (since 35 + 29 = 64).
</think>
<answer> 32 + 3 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 32, 95, and 37 exactly once to get a result of 26. Looking at the numbers, it seems that subtraction might be useful because 95 - 32 equals 63, which when combined with other numbers can potentially produce 26.
If I subtract 37 from 63, I get 26. So the equation would be: (95 - 32) - 37 = 26.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 32) - 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 47, 81, and 4. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 30. 
We can start by looking at the ways we can combine 47 and 81. If we subtract 47 from 81, we get 34. 
Now we need to get from 34 to 30. Subtracting 4 from 34 will give us exactly 30.
So the equation becomes: 81 - 47 - 4 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 47 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 47, 81, and 4 exactly once. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
- One possibility is to use subtraction and addition. If we subtract 47 from 81, we get 34. Then we need to get to 30, so we would need to subtract 4. This gives us the equation: 81 - 47 - 4 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 47 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 87, 66, and 86 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.
87 + 66 - 86 = 153 - 86 = 67, which is close but not 65.
87 + 86 - 66 = 173 - 66 = 107, which is too big.
66 + 86 - 87 = 152 - 87 = 65, this seems to be a valid equation!
So, the equation is 66 + 86 - 87 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 86 - 87 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 100 using the numbers 89, 92, and 81. Looking at these numbers, let's consider if we can use any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If I use 92 as it is and add 89 and 81, I get:
92 + 89 + 81
Now, let's add these numbers:
92 + 89 = 181
181 + 81 = 262
This is close to 100 but not quite there. Let's try another combination.
Now let's consider if we subtract a smaller number from a larger one and combine it with another number. If we use:
92 - 81 + 89
Calculating this:
92 - 81 = 11
11 + 89 = 100
This gives us the result of 100. So the equation we need is 92 - 81 + 89.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 81 + 89 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 9, 10, and 71. We need to combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 52.
Starting with the largest number, 71, we can subtract 9 to get 62. Now we need to get from 62 to 52. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 62.
So combining these steps, we have: 71 - 9 - 10 = 52.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 9 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 9, 10, and 71. We need to combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 52.
- If we look at the numbers closely, 10 - 9 = 1, which is very close to 52.
- Now, we need to get 51 from 71 and 1.
- If we subtract 10 from 71, we get 61.
- To get 52 from 61 by using 1, we can subtract 9 (since 61 - 9 = 52).
So the equation is: 71 - 10 - 9 = 52.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 10 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 45, 83, 56, and 52 that equals 34. I will try to use combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's start with subtraction:
83 - 45 = 38
Now, I have 38 and I need to get to 34. I can try:
38 - 4 = 34
But 4 isn't available. Let's try another combination.
I can try with multiplication and subtraction instead:
83 * 52 = 4348 (This is too large)
Now let's try 56 and 52:
56 * 52 = 2912 (This is also too large)
I have to try another approach. How about manipulating the subtraction:
45 - 52 = -7
But -7 is not useful with the remaining numbers. Let's keep working on it.
Now, let's try:
83 - 56 = 27
Then 27 - 52 = -25 (Not 34)
Let's try the sum:
52 + 56 = 108 (This is way too large)
Let's try this:
45 + 52 = 97 (This is too high)
Okay, I need to converge on 34. If I try:
83 + 45 - 56 = 72 - 56 = 16 (This is not 34)
Trying another combination:
45 + 52 - 56 = 97 - 56 = 41 (This is also not 34)
I have to try:
56 + 45 - 52 = 101 - 52 = 49 (This is not 34)
Finally, I think I see the correct combination:
83 - 56 - 45 + 52 = 27 - 45 + 52 = -18 + 52 = 34
This gives us 34.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 56 - 45 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 16, 54, and 8 exactly once to get 30. 
Firstly, if we look at the numbers, 54 - 16 = 38, which is quite close to 30. If we subtract 8 from 38, we get 30.
So the equation would be 54 - 16 - 8 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 54 - 16 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 85, 27, 69, 75. We need to use each of these once to get a result of 86.
- Subtract 27 from 85 to get 58. So, 85 - 27 = 58.
- Now, 86 - 58 = 28. We have used 27 and 85 so far.
- 75 + 69 = 144. However, this is too large, so let's try subtracting instead.
- Subtract 69 from 75 to get 6, but this is not aligning with our target.
- Now, taking another shot, let's consider 75 - 69 + 85 - 27. This gives us 6 + 58 = 84, which is close but still short.
- Let's try 85 - 27 - 69 + 75. This evaluates to 85 - 27 - 69 + 75 = 75 - 69 + 75 = 6 + 75 = 81, which is still not 86.
- This seems tricky, so let's think of another way. Reconsider 85 - 27 + 69 - 75. This evaluates to 85 - 27 + 69 - 75 = 58 + 69 - 75 = 127 - 75 = 52, which is far from our target.
- Another possibility is if we look closely: 75 + (85 - 27 - 69) = 75 + 85 - 27 - 69 = 160 - 96 = 64. Still short.
- Let's try a new combination: 75 - (85 - 27) + 69. This evaluates to 75 - 85 + 27 + 69 = -10 + 27 + 69 = 19 + 69 = 86.
This gives us the equation: 75 - (85 - 27) + 69 = 86.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (85 - 27) + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 21, and 5 that equals 31. Let's try combining them using arithmetic operations.
- One possibility could be to add 15 and 5, then subtract 21. 
- Adding 15 and 5 gives 20.
- Subtracting 21 from 20 gives -1, which is not 31.
- Another possible combination is to multiply 15 by 21, but that gives 315, which is too large.
- A combination that works is adding 21 to 5, which equals 26, and then subtracting 15 from it: 21 + 5 - 15.
- This results in 26 - 15 = 11.
- This isn't 31 either.
It seems I need a different approach. Let's try multiplying 15 by 2, then subtracting 16 (which is 21 - 5).
- Multiplying 15 by 2 gives 30.
- Subtracting 16 from 30 gives 14, which is still not 31.
Lastly, let's consider multiplying 15 by 2 and then adding 5: 15 * 2 + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35, which is too large.
After trying these possibilities, we could actually reorder and use: multiply 21 by 1 (which is just 21), and 15 by 2 to get 30, then add to 5 to get 31: (21 * 1) + (15 * 2) + 5 = 21 + 30 + 5 = 56, which is incorrect.
The correct approach seems to be using: 21 - (15 - 5) = 21 - 10 = 11, which is incorrect again.
Finally, working with these numbers, if I rearrange and use: 15 + 21 - 5 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 15 + 21 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 15, 21, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once and the operations +, -, *, / to make the equation equal 31.
One way to achieve this is to use multiplication and subtraction creatively.
We can start by multiplying 15 and 5, which gives 75. Then we subtract 21 from this result.
So, the equation would be (15 * 5) - 21 = 75 - 21 = 54 - 23, but this doesn't equal 31. We need to re-evaluate the combination of operations and numbers.
Let's try another approach: add 15 and 21 first, then subtract 5 from the result.
(15 + 21) - 5 = 36 - 5 = 31.
This gives us the correct result of 31. Thus, the equation is (15 + 21) - 5.
</think>
<answer> (15 + 21) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 7, and 33. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to create an equation that equals 30.
- We can start by trying to use addition and subtraction to get close to 30.
- 56 + 7 = 63, which is too high.
- 56 - 33 = 23, which is close to 30 but still not quite there.
- Now let's consider if we can use multiplication or division to adjust this result.
- Dividing 56 by 7 gives us 8, which is not immediately helpful.
- Multiplying 8 by 33 would give us a number much too large, so we need to find a combination.
- If we add 7 to 33, we get 40, which is close, but too high.
- If we subtract instead of adding 33 to 7, we get 7 - 33 = -26, which is too low.
- Let's try another combination: 33 - 7 = 26, and then 56 - 26 = 30.
So, the equation can be established as 56 - (33 - 7) = 30.
</think>
<answer> 56 - (33 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 82, 19, and 82 that results in 19, I need to use each number only once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations.
- First, I notice that 82 - 82 = 0, which doesn't help us reach 19.
- Next, I see that if I take 82 and subtract 19, I get 63, which is close but not the answer.
- Then, I realize that 82 - (82 - 19) = 19.
- Calculating inside the parentheses: 82 - 63 = 19.
So, the equation is 82 - (82 - 19).
</think>
<answer> 82 - (82 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 77, and 14. We need to use each number exactly once to create an equation that equals 25. Let's start by looking at the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
If we divide 77 by 14, we get 5.5. Now our numbers are 88, 5.5, and 14.
Adding 5.5 to 88 gives us 93.5, which is not 25. Subtracting 14 from 88 gives us 74, which is also not 25.
Now let's consider another combination: 88 minus 77 is 11. Then we have 14 and 11. If we add these together, we get 25.
So the equation is 88 - 77 + 14 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 77 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 16, 82, and 2 exactly once to result in 96. Looking at the numbers, 82 is quite far from 96, so it might be useful to subtract a smaller number from it. The number 2 could be used for this purpose. If I subtract 2 from 82, I get 80. Now I need to reach 96 from 80 using the number 16. Adding 16 to 80 gives me 96. Therefore, the equation is 82 - 2 + 16 = 96.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 2 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 16, 82, and 2 exactly once to get 96. Let's try different combinations:
- If I use multiplication, 82 * 2 = 164, which is not 96.
- If I use addition and subtraction, 82 + 16 - 2 = 96, which equals 96.
So the equation should be 82 + 16 - 2.
</think>
<answer> 82 + 16 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 2, and 58. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that results in 20.
- Let's look at multiplication and subtraction: (58 - 40) / 2
  This simplifies to 8 / 2 which equals 4, not 20.
- Now, let's try division and addition: 40 / (58 - 2)
  This simplifies to 40 / 56, which doesn't equal 20 either.
- Next, let's consider a different combination: (58 + 2) - 40
  This simplifies to 60 - 40, which equals 20.
Therefore, the equation we are looking for is: (58 + 2) - 40 = 20.
</think>
<answer> (58 + 2) - 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 95 using the numbers 98, 10, 68, and 75 exactly once. Let's try combining the numbers in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
If I add 98 and 68, I get 166. Then, if I subtract 75 from it, I get 91. Now, I need to get from 91 to 95, so I need to subtract 6. But 6 is not one of the given numbers. 
Instead, let's try another combination: subtract 10 from 98 to get 88. Then, subtract 68 from it to get 20. Finally, I need to get from 20 to 95, so I need to add 75, but it's not available.
Now, let's try 98 + 10 = 108, then 108 - 68 = 40. Now, I need to get from 40 to 95 by using the last number, which is 75. Clearly, there's no immediate way with the current numbers. 
Let's try a different approach: 75 + 68 = 143. This is too high. So, let's look at the remaining pair: 98 - 75 = 23. Now, we need 72 more to get to 95. Using 10 combined with 68, I can get this by 10 + 68 = 78, which isn't sufficient. 
Finally, let's try: 98 - 10 = 88, then 88 - 68 = 20, and 20 + 75 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 10 - 68 + 75 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 73, 1, and 90 exactly once, resulting in the number 18.
- One possible approach is to use the number 90 and the number 1 in a way that gives a significant result, and then adjust with the number 73.
- If I add 73 to 90, I get 163. This is much larger than 18, so I need to subtract from this sum.
- I can subtract 73 from 163 to get 90, and then subtract 75 to get to 18.
But 75 isn't in our list, so I can't use that.
- Another possibility is to subtract 90 from 73 and then add 1.
- This would give me 73 - 90 + 1 = -6 + 1 = -5, which is not 18.
- So, I will try another combination: using 1 and 90 in multiplication and then subtracting 73.
- Multiplying 1 and 90 gives 90, and then subtracting 73 from 90 gives 17.
- This is close but not exactly 18. 
- The final approach could involve using 1 as a multiplier for 90, then subtracting 73.
- Multiplying 1 by 90 gives 90, and then subtracting 73 from 90 gives 17.
- The direct approach seemed to miss some flexibility, so a final step: using 1 to modify 90 through some arithmetic gives the equation: 90 - 73 + 1 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 73 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 49, 16, and 74 exactly once to get the result of 41. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If I look at the numbers 49 and 16, their difference is 33 (49 - 16 = 33). This suggests we should look for how 33 relates to 74 and 41.
If I use 33 from 49 - 16 and add 74 to it, I get:
(49 - 16) + 74 = 33 + 74 = 107, which is too large.
Instead, if I subtract 74 from 107, I get:
107 - 74 = 33.
This shows 16 + 33 = 49.
Now, what should we do with these results to get 41?
Let's check the original numbers again and see if we can use subtraction here:
49 - (16 + 74) is not possible since the parenthesis would make it 49 - 16 - 74, which is -41.
However, if we put together 16 + 33 (which equals 49) and 74 - 33 (which equals 41), we get the answer.
So the equation would be:
74 - (49 - 16) = 74 - 33 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 74 - (49 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's assess the numbers we have: 11, 53, and 24. We need to use these once each to make 88 using basic arithmetic operations. Looking at the numbers, we see that 53 + 24 = 77, but this is not going to work as we need to reach 88. Instead, consider 53 - 24 = 29. Now we need another number to reach 88, and we can use 11. Adding 11 to 29 gives us 40, which is far from 88. Let's think differently - if we take 53 + 24 and then add 11, we get exactly 88.
</think>
<answer> (53 + 24) + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 86 using the numbers 54, 41, 46, and 27 exactly once. Let's start by looking at the numbers:
- 54 + 41 = 95
- 54 + 46 = 100
- 54 + 27 = 81
- 41 + 46 = 87
- 41 + 27 = 68
- 46 + 27 = 73
It seems adding these numbers doesn't quite get us to 86. Now let's try a different approach:
- 54 + 46 - 27 = 73, which is close but still not 86.
Let's try another combination:
- 54 + 41 + 27 = 122, which is too large.
- 46 + 41 - 27 = 60, which is far from 86.
Now, let's consider subtraction differently:
- 54 - 41 + 46 = 59, still not 86.
- Trying 54 + 41 - 46 = 49.
Finally, I try another combination:
- (54 + 46) - (41 - 27) = 100 - (-14) = 100 + 14 = 114, which is not 86.
We seem to be close with 54 + 46 + 27 - 41 = 94, which is 86 if we account for the operation correctly.
So, let's try:
(54 + 46) + (27 - 41) = 100 - 14 = 86.
</think>
<answer>(54 + 46) + (27 - 41)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 86 using the numbers 54, 41, 46, and 27. Looking at the options, 46 + 27 = 73 seems like a useful intermediate step.
Next, I need to reach 86 from 73. If I add 13 to 73, that's what I'll need. The only way to form 13 from the remaining set of numbers 54 and 41 is by subtracting 41 from 54, which equals 13.
So, the equation is 46 + 27 + (54 - 41) = 86.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 27 + (54 - 41) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 42, 13, 30, and 3 to get 88. If we look at the numbers, we can see that 42 + 30 = 72, which is close to 88. If we then try to add another number to get to 88, adding 13 will give us 85, which is close but not quite 88. The next step would be to check if we can use the 3 in a way that helps. Adding 3 to 85 doesn't work directly, but we can consider subtraction. If we subtract 3 from 85, we get 82, and if we then add 6, we get 88. But we only have one number left, 3, and we cannot use the same number twice.
So let's try another approach: we can consider if there's a combination that uses all numbers. We have 42 - 13 = 29, then we can add 30 to get 59, and finally, adding 3 will give us 62, which is still not 88.
Another attempt: if we try 42 + 30 = 72, then 72 + 13 + 3 = 88. This works as we are allowed to add 13 and 3 to the result of 72.
</think>
<answer> 42 + 30 + 13 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 71, 99, and 86 exactly once to equal 84. Let's see if we can manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic.
I notice that 99 - 86 = 13. That’s a useful number to work with.
Now, if I add 13 to 71, I get 84: 71 + 13 = 84.
So the equation that equals 84 using these numbers exactly once is 71 + (99 - 86).
</think>
<answer> 71 + (99 - 86) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 68, 44, and 19 that equals 43. Let's try combining the numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
19 + 44 = 63
Now, if I subtract 68 from 63:
63 - 68 = -5
This doesn't give us 43. Let's try another combination.
(68 - 44) = 24
Now if I subtract 19 from 24:
24 - 19 = 5
This is still not the result we want. Let's try this:
(68 + 19) = 87
Now if I subtract 44 from 87:
87 - 44 = 43
So, the equation 68 + 19 - 44 equals 43.
</think>
<answer> (68 + 19) - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 84, 24, and 21 that equals 81. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If I divide 84 by 21, I get 4. Then, if I add 24 to 4, I get 28, which is not 81.
Now, let's try another combination. If I subtract 21 from 84, I get 63. If I then subtract 24 from 63, I get 39, which is still not 81.
Next, let's see what happens if I add 24 to 21, which gives me 45. Then I subtract 84 from 45, I get -39.
Now, thinking about the operations again, I notice that if I divide 21 by 24, I get approximately 0.875. Adding 84 to this would give me 84.875, which is still not 81.
In the meantime, I should consider not mixing all the numbers. For instance, if I use 84 - (21 / 24) = 84 - 0.875 which is slightly off. 
Finally, I tried another approach: 84 - 24 + 21. Doing this yields 81.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 24 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 32 using the numbers 90, 44, 54, and 48 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combining 90 and 48 first. If I subtract 48 from 90, I get 42. Now I have 42 - 54 and 44. If I subtract 54 from 42, I get -12, which isn't helpful. Let's try 90 - 44 first - that gives me 46. Now, I have 46 + 54 and 48. 46 + 54 is 100, but this isn't 32.
Let's try another combination: If I use 44 + 48, I get 92. Then, I have 92 - 54, which is 38. That's still not 32. 
Next, I'll try 54 - 44 = 10. Then, I have 10 + 48, which is 58. That's too big.
Since none of these combinations worked, I'll try rearranging: If I use 90 - 48 = 42, then I have 42 - 54, which is -12. That's not 32.
Let's try 90 - 54 = 36. Now I have 36 - 44, which is -8. That's not 32 either.
Finally, let's try 48 - 44 = 4. Now I have 90 - 54 + 4, which is 40 - 54, which is -14. That's still not 32.
After these steps, I realize I've reviewed all the possible straightforward combinations. Considering 90 - 54 = 36, and then 36 - 48 = -12, and other combinations combined, I realize I've missed a more creative approach.
Considering 90 - 54 = 36 and then rearranging to 44 + 36 - 48, it simplifies to 80 - 48 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 54 + 44 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 38, 32, and 32 to get 38. One way to do this could be to use the second 32 as a result of subtracting the first 32 from 38.
38 - 32 = 6
But we need to use all the numbers, so let's consider using the first 32 as part of the equation. If we add 32 to 6, we get 38.
32 + 6 = 38
So, the equation becomes: 32 + (38 - 32)
Combining these parts gives us the final equation.
</think>
<answer> 32 + (38 - 32) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 64, 9, and 13 that equals 86. Looking at the numbers, it seems combining 64 and 13 will likely get us closer to 86:
64 + 13 = 77.
Now, we need an additional 9 to reach 86. Adding 9 to 77 gives us:
77 + 9 = 86.
So the equation is 64 + 13 + 9 = 86.
</think>
<answer> 64 + 13 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 35, 60, and 28 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
I'll start by looking at the numbers and considering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If I add 60 and 28 together, I get 88, which is too high. Subtracting 28 from 60 gives me 32 which is still not 53.
Multiplying 35 and 28 gives me 980 which is way too high.
Dividing 60 by 28 leaves me with a non-integer result.
Next, if I subtract the relatively smaller number 28 from the larger number 60, I get 32.
Now, if I add the remaining 35, I get 32 + 35 = 67 which is too high.
Subtracting 35 from 60 instead gives me 25 which is still not 53.
If I subtract 35 from 60 and then add the remaining 28, I get 60 - 35 + 28 = 53.
This combination works as expected.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 35 + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 35, 60, and 28 exactly once to get to 53. We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One approach could be to subtract a smaller number from a larger one. If I subtract 28 from 60, I get 32. Then adding 35 to this result gives 67, which is close but too high.
Instead, let's try 35 + (60 - 28). First, we calculate 60 - 28, which equals 32. Then we add 35 to 32, resulting in 67, which is still too high.
We need to adjust. Let's try 60 - (35 + 28). First, 35 + 28 equals 63, and then subtracting that from 60 gives -3, which is not what we want.
Another combination could be 60 - 35 + 28. Starting with 60 - 35 gives 25, and then adding 28 to this results in 53. This seems to be correct.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 35 + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 54, 25, and 16 that equals 95. I should consider both addition and subtraction operations.
Let's start by looking at the largest number, 54, which is close to 95. If we subtract this from 95, we get 41 (54 - 95 = -41, but we need a positive 41). However, 41 is not available.
Then, consider multiplying 25 and 16: 25 * 16 = 400, which is too large. Also, 54 + 25 + 16 = 95, but we're not allowed to repeat the numbers.
Next, let's try 54 + 25 = 79. Now, to reach 95, we need 16 more. Since 16 + 79 = 95, this combination works.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 25 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using 54, 25, and 16 that equals 95. Let's see if we can manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
Considering 54 is the largest number, it might be useful as a starting point. Let's try to express 95 in a way where 54 is part of the solution:
54 + 25 = 79 (which is close to 95 but not quite there yet)
We need an additional 16 to reach 95. So, 54 + 25 + 16 should give us 95.
(54 + 25) + 16 = 95
</think>
<answer>(54 + 25) + 16</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 41, 12, and 29. We need an equation that uses each of these once to equal 82.
- If we subtract 29 from 41, we get 12, which is one of our numbers.
- So now we need 12 from 41 + 29 to be 82.
- This means 41 + 29 = 70, and we need an additional 12 (12 from the original set) to reach 82.
- Therefore, the equation can be (41 + 29) + 12 = 82.
</think>
<answer>(41 + 29) + 12</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 37, 61, 39, and 15 using basic arithmetic operations to get 74. One approach could be to use the larger numbers for the first step and then work with the smaller numbers.
39 + 37 = 76
Now, we're 2 away from 74, so we can use 15 - 2 to correct this. 15 - 2 = 13
Finally, 76 - 13 = 63, which is not 74, so let's try another approach.
Using 61 - 39 = 22
Then, using 37 + 15 = 52
Now, combining these: 22 + 52 = 74, which is what we need.
</think>
<answer> (61 - 39) + (37 + 15) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 76, 67, and 74. We need to create an equation using each of these numbers exactly once to get 69.
One approach is to see if there's a way to get as close to 69 as possible by adding or subtracting these numbers.
If we subtract 74 from 76, we get 2.
Then, if we add 67 to this result, we get 72.
This is close to 69, but we need to be off by 3.
We know that 72 - 3 = 69, so we can use the numbers 76, 67, and 74 to create the equation: 76 - 74 + 67 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 74 + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 87, 95, and 40. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, and with basic arithmetic operations, so that the result is 48.
If we look at 95 - 40 = 55, we are getting closer to 48. If we then take 87 - 55, we get 32, which is not 48 either. But, if we try adding and subtracting in another way.
95 - 40 = 55. Now, 55 - 87 = -32 (which is not helpful).
Let's try another combination: 95 + 40 = 135, which is far from 48.
Now, let's try 87 - (95 - 40). This simplifies to 87 - 55 = 32, which is still not 48.
It seems the combination we are looking for must be: 95 + (87 - 40) = 95 + 47 = 142, which is still not 48.
Finally, let's try 95 - (87 - 40). This simplifies to 95 - 37 = 58, which is close but not 48.
We need to find another way to combine the numbers. Let's consider: 95 - (87 + 40). This won't work since it results in a negative number.
Trying 40 + (87 - 95): 40 + 32 = 72 which is too large.
Let's try 95 - (87 - 40): This gives 95 - 47 = 48, which is correct.
</think>
<answer> 95 - (87 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 87, 95, and 40. We need to form an equation using these numbers once only and with basic arithmetic operations that equals 48.
One potential equation we can try is 95 - 87 + 40. Let's break this down:
95 - 87 = 8 (This is the result of subtracting 87 from 95)
Next, we add 40 to this result:
8 + 40 = 48
Therefore, the equation is 95 - 87 + 40 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 87 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers available: 81, 29, and 81. We need to create an equation that equals 29 using each number exactly once.
One way to approach this is to consider if we can use subtraction or division to reduce the total. If we subtract 81 from 81, we get 0. Then we need to add 29 to 0 to get 29. However, we don't have a 29 available, so this isn't working.
Instead, 29/81 will give us a number less than 1, but not quite 29. Multiplying this by 81 should theoretically return 29. Let's try: 29 / 81 * 81.
Calculating this: 29 / 81 * 81 = 29.
So, the equation 29 / 81 * 81 equals 29 when we use each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 29 / 81 * 81 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 78, 55, and 30. We need to create an equation that equals 53 using all these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by subtracting 30 from 55. That gives us 25. Next, we need 53 - 25 = 28 from using 78. We can get 28 by subtracting 30 from 78, which gives us 48. So, we have used 30 twice, but we need to use each number only once. Therefore, let's reframe it with 78 - (55 - 30). This gives us 78 - 25 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 78 - (55 - 30) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 78, 55, and 30. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations that equals 53.
We can try combining these numbers in different ways. Let's start with subtraction:
- If we subtract 30 from 78, we get 48. Then we need to get from 48 to 53 by using 55. We can add 55 to 48, which gives us 103. But this is not what we want.
- Now let's try multiplication and subtraction:
- Multiplying 55 by 1 gives us 55. Then if we subtract 30 from 78, we get 48. But 55 - 48 does not give us 53.
- Let's try 55 - (78 - 30). This simplifies to 55 - 48, which equals 7, not 53.
- Now, let's try 78 - (55 - 30). This simplifies to 78 - 25, which equals 53. This gives us the correct result.
So the equation using these numbers and basic arithmetic operations that equals 53 is 78 - (55 - 30).
</think>
<answer> 78 - (55 - 30) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 57, 66, and 77. We need to create an equation that equals 46 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 77 - 66 + 57. This doesn't work because 77 - 66 + 57 equals 68.
Let's try another approach: 77 - 66 + 57. This again doesn't give us 46.
Then let's try 66 + 57 - 77. This gives us 66 + 57 = 123, and subtracting 77 gives us 46.
Therefore, the equation is 66 + 57 - 77.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 57 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 15, 6, and 5. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get the result of 95 using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look for operations that could significantly increase the value of the sum. Notice that 15 + 6 + 5 equals 26. To reach 95, we need to multiply this sum by 3.5, which isn't straightforward with standard arithmetic operations using the numbers given.
However, if we rearrange our thinking, we consider the possibility of subtraction and multiplication. Notice that:
- 15 * 6 = 90
- 90 + 5 = 95
This works because if we first multiply 15 by 6, we get 90, and then add 5, we reach 95.
</think>
<answer> 15 * 6 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 68, 42, and 24 that equals 86. Let's start by considering the numbers and how they can be combined with basic arithmetic operations.
If I subtract 24 from 42, I get 18 (42 - 24 = 18). 
Then, if I add 68 to 18, I get 86 (68 + 18 = 86).
So, the equation would be 68 + (42 - 24) = 86.
</think>
<answer> 68 + (42 - 24) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 68, 42, and 24 exactly once to get the result of 86. Let's try to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If I look at the numbers, 68 is relatively large by itself but I need to reach 86. Taking 24 from 68 gives me 44, which is closer to 86. Now, I need to get 42 to add to 44 to make 86.
44 + 42 = 86, which solves the problem.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 24 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 17, 28, and 33 exactly once and results in 12. 
I'll start by looking at the numbers: 17, 28, and 33. 
17 + 28 equals 45, which is too large, and 33 + 17 equals 50, which is also too large.
28 + 17 - 33 equals 6, which is too small.
Then, I consider 28 - (17 + 33): 
28 - (17 + 33) = 28 - 50 = -22, which is not useful.
I then try 17 + (28 - 33): 
17 + (28 - 33) = 17 + (-5) = 12, which is exactly what we need.
So the equation that uses the numbers 17, 28, and 33 together to get 12 is 17 + (28 - 33).
</think>
<answer> 17 + (28 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 8, 17, and 92. We need to use these numbers exactly once and any combination of basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 67.
We can start by looking at the larger number, 92, as a potential value that when modified by the other numbers will result in 67.
If we subtract 92 by 17, we get 75. This seems close but not quite 67. Now, if we take 75 and subtract 8, we get 67. So the equation would be 92 - 17 - 8 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 17 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 78, and 88. We need to create an equation that equals 11 using each number exactly once.
We can start by looking at simple operations and combinations:
- 88 - 78 = 10, which is close to 11.
- If we subtract 7 from 88 we get 83.
- We need to decrement this value by 73 to get 11.
- 88 - 78 = 10
- Adding 1 to this result does not give us 11.
- Another approach: consider 88 - 78 + 1 = 11
</think>
<answer> 88 - 78 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 50 using the numbers 94, 17, and 27 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Considering the numbers, subtracting 27 from 94 gives 67. Then if I subtract 17 from 67, I get 50.
So the equation would be: 94 - 27 - 17 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 27 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 25, 74, 9, and 1 exactly once to get 57. Let's start by looking at the target number (57) and the numbers we have.
- The number 74 is quite large, so it might be useful as a larger operand in an addition.
- The number 25 is also large, suggesting it might be subtracted from or added to a smaller number.
- The number 9 seems to be a good candidate for subtraction, as 25 - 9 = 16.
- The number 1, if used added to or subtracted from smaller numbers, will not significantly change the value.
Now let's see how we can use these:
- If we take 74 - 25 + 9, we get 54. This is close but not 57.
Let's try another combination:
- If we use 74 - 25 + 9 - 1, we get 57.
This combination works as 74 - 25 = 49, then 49 + 9 = 58, and finally 58 - 1 = 57.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 25 + 9 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 67, 38, and 53. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 52.
- We can try the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's start by trying to subtract or add the numbers to see if we can approach 52.
- If we subtract 38 from 67, we get 29 (67 - 38 = 29).
- Now, we need to get from 29 to 52. Adding 23 to 29 doesn't work, but adding 53 (the remaining number) would give us 82, which is too much.
- Let's try another combination: if we subtract 53 from 67, we get 14 (67 - 53 = 14).
- Now we need to reach 52 from 14. Adding 38 to 14 is 52 (14 + 38 = 52).
- So, the equation is: (67 - 53) + 38 = 52.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 53) + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 33, 96, and 21 that equals 42. Looking at the numbers, I notice that 96 - 33 = 63, which is quite close to 42. If I subtract 63 from 21, I get -42, which isn't what I want. Instead, let's try a different combination.
Considering the numbers again, if I add 21 to 33, I get 54. Now, if I subtract 12 from 54 (since 96 - 54 = 42), I can achieve the target. So, 54 - 12 = 42. But I need to use 96. Let's see how I can get 12 using 33 and 21.
If I divide 33 by 21, I get approximately 1.57, which isn't an integer. However, if I consider 21 - (33 / 21), it doesn't work out. Let's rethink this.
Then, I realize another combination: 96 - 21 - 33 = 42. This directly uses all the numbers and results in 42.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 21 - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 74, 79, and 62. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 91.
- If we look at 79 and 62, their difference is 17 (79 - 62 = 17).
- Adding 74 to 17 gives us 91 (74 + 17 = 91).
So, the equation that works is 74 + (79 - 62) = 91.
</think>
<answer> 74 + (79 - 62) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 91, 22, and 33 exactly once to get 80. Let's start by checking if there's a combination of these numbers that, through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, will give us 80.
We can try different combinations. If we subtract 22 from 91, we get 69. Then if we add 33 to 69, we get 102, which isn't 80.
Let's try another combination: first, we take 33 from 91, which gives 58. Now, subtracting 22 from 58 gives us 36, which is still not 80.
If we consider division, 91 divided by 33 is approximately 2.73 (not an integer), and 22 divided by 33 also doesn't give an integer that helps us get 80.
Let's look at another possibility with multiplication and subtraction: 33 * 22 = 726, which is way more than 80. But let's try 91 - 33 * 22 / 22 = 91 - 33 = 58, still not there.
After reviewing all the potential operations and combinations, I realize that the direct method I thought of didn't quite work. However, looking at the numbers again: 91 - 33 = 58, then 58 + 22 = 80.
So, the equation is 91 - 33 + 22 = 80.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 33 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to find a way to use the numbers 28, 71, and 24 exactly once to get 67. Let's start by looking at the numbers and considering basic operations.
One good idea could be to use 71 as the larger number and then subtract the other two numbers to get closer to 67. If we use 71 - 28, we get 43. Now, we need to get from 43 to 67, which is 24 more. So, 43 + 24 = 67.
Therefore, the equation can be: 71 - 28 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 28 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 80, 32, 16, and 47 that equals 17. Looking at the numbers, 32 and 16 add up to 48. If I subtract 48 from 80, I get 32. So, 80 - 32 = 48. Now I need to use the number 47 and 16 to get to 17. Subtracting 16 from 47 gives me 31. Finally, to get to 17 from 31, I need to divide by 2, but 2 is not one of our numbers. Instead, if I use the 48 I've already created and subtract 31 (47 - 16), and then subtract that from 80 (80 - (47 - 16)), I get 17. The numbers 47 and 16 do not directly subtract to give us the required number, but we can simplify it by considering a different approach. If I take 80 - 32 = 48, and then 48 - 31 = 17 since 48 - (47 - 16) gives us 17, this satisfies the condition with our numbers. </think>
<answer> 80 - 32 - (47 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 5, and 93 that equals 76. Let's start by looking at the operations and the numbers we have.
- If I subtract 5 from 22, I get 17 (22 - 5 = 17).
- Then if I subtract 93 from 17, I get -76 (17 - 93 = -76), which is close but in the wrong direction.
- Multiplying 5 by 93 gives me 465, which is much too large, so that won't work.
- Adding 22 and 5 gives me 27, and then adding 93 doesn't get me to 76 either.
- The optimal way to make 76 is to use 93 as it is and combine it with 22 in a suitable way.
- Since no direct combination with 22 already in the equation results in 76, I can use -22 (-22 + 22 = 0) to indirectly make use of 22 as part of the final solution.
- So far, -22 + 22 + 5 + 93 = 93 cannot work either, so focusing on the direct paths.
- Now, I see that 76 - 22 = 54, and 54 - 5 = 49, which then subtracted by 93 doesn't apply well. 
- Hence, using 93 - 5 - 22 = 66, which is too large.
- Going back to the combination, 93 - 5 = 88, 88 - 22 = 66, and 66 + 5 = 71.
- Finally, 93 - 22 + 5 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 22 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 30, 26, 29, and 26. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 59. One way to approach this is to look at combinations of addition and subtraction.
If we add 30 and 26, we get 56. Now we need 3 more to reach 59. We can get that by adding 29 - 26 = 3. So, the equation becomes 30 + 26 + (29 - 26), which equals 59.
</think>
<answer> 30 + 26 + (29 - 26) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 50, and 75 that results in 51.
We can start by checking combinations of addition and subtraction between the numbers. Let's try subtracting 50 from 74 and then adding 75:
74 - 50 + 75
Now let's calculate this:
74 - 50 = 24
24 + 75 = 99
This does not give us 51, so this approach is not correct.
Next, let's try another combination: subtracting 75 from 74 and then adding 50:
74 - 75 + 50
Now let's calculate this:
74 - 75 = -1
-1 + 50 = 49
This also does not give us 51, so this approach isn't correct either.
Finally, let's try the operation of dividing 74 by 75 and then adding 50:
(74 / 75) + 50
Now let's calculate this:
74 / 75 = 0.986666...
0.986666... + 50 = 50.986666...
This does not give us the desired result of 51 either.
It seems none of these straightforward operations yield the desired result. Let's try a different approach, perhaps by reordering or rethinking the operations.
Let's try the combination:
75 - 50 + 74
Now let's calculate this:
75 - 50 = 25
25 + 74 = 99
Still not 51. 
Now, let's try this:
50 + 74 - 75
Let's calculate:
50 + 74 = 124
124 - 75 = 49
Let's try another:
75 + 50 - 74
Let's calculate:
75 + 50 = 125
125 - 74 = 51
So this works:
75 + 50 - 74 = 51
</think>
<answer> 75 + 50 - 74 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers given: 62, 84, 88, and 93. We need to construct an equation that uses exactly these numbers once and only once to get the result of 35.
Let's try combinations of addition and subtraction:
62 + 84 = 146 (not 35)
62 + 88 = 150 (not 35)
62 + 93 = 155 (not 35)
84 + 88 = 172 (not 35)
84 + 93 = 177 (not 35)
88 + 93 = 181 (not 35)
Now let's try combinations with subtraction:
62 - 84 = -22 (not 35)
62 - 88 = -26 (not 35)
62 - 93 = -31 (not 35)
84 - 88 = -4 (not 35)
84 - 93 = -49 (not 35)
88 - 93 = -5 (not 35)
Now using multiplication and division doesn't seem useful as it would either increase or decrease the numbers too much to reach 35:
(62 * 84) / (88 * 93) = 51408 / 8064 = 6.39 (not 35)
However, if we rearrange, we can use:
(88 - 93) + 62 = -5 + 62 = 57
This still doesn't work. However, we might mix different operations:
84 - 62 + 88 - 93 = 22 + 88 - 93 = 110 - 93 = 17
This also doesn't work. But let's try another way:
93 - 84 + 88 - 62 = 9 + 88 - 62 = 97 - 62 = 35
This combination yields 35.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 84 + 88 - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 59, 25, 19, and 92 that equals 27. Let's consider the possible operations between these numbers.
- If I subtract 92 by 59, I get 33. This is too high.
- Trying 92 - 25 gives me 67, still too high.
- Then, 92 - 19 = 73, much too high.
Now, let's try different combinations. If I take 92 - 59, I get 33, and if I subtract 25 from that, I get 33 - 25 = 8.
Perhaps if I do 19 - 25, I'll get -6, which when added to 92 - 59 = 33, could bring the total close. So, -6 + 33 = 27.
Therefore, the equation is (92 - 59) - (25 - 19) = 27.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 59) - (25 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 27, 2, and 11 that equals 40. Let's consider all the operations we have: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
We can start with the larger number, 27, and try to use the other numbers in a way that will help us get close to 40:
27 + 2 = 29
This is close to 40, so we need an additional 11 to make it 40.
27 + 2 + 11 = 40
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and satisfies the condition of making 40.
</think>
<answer> 27 + 2 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 58, and 22 which equals 97. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/).
First, if I look at the numbers, 58 and 22 add up to 80 (58 + 22 = 80). Then to get from 80 to 97, we need to add 17 (80 + 17 = 97).
So the equation would be 58 + 22 + 17 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 58 + 22 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 36, 77, and 4. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 45. We can start by trying different combinations of operations.
One way to approach this is to consider if any number can be combined to get closer to 45.
If we look at 77 and 4, we get 77 - 4 = 73, which is too high.
If we consider 36 + 4, we get 36 + 4 = 40, which is still not 45.
Let's try using division. 77 / 4 leaves us with 19.25, which is not an integer and obviously not 45.
Now let's try subtraction and multiplication. If we calculate (77 - 36) * 4, we get:
77 - 36 = 41
41 * 4 = 164, far from 45.
Then we see there should be a better combination. We see that, if we use 77 - 36 = 41 and then 41 / 4 = 10 remainder 1.125, isn't close to all.
We try another approach: 36 + 77 - 4 = 113 - 4 = 109. This is too large.
Adding and subtracting in different combinations do not get to 45. Lastly, we find that: 36 + 77 / 4 = 36 + 19.25 = 55. 25 is too large,
Trying another combination: 77 - 36 + 4 = 41 + 4 = 45. This works!
</think>
<answer> 77 - 36 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 77, and 4 that equals 45. Let's try different combinations:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers directly doesn't give us 45.
- Multiplying or dividing any of these numbers doesn't seem to work since we can't get to 45 with just one number operation.
- Now let's try a combination of addition and subtraction: 77 - 36 + 4 = 45.
This combination seems to work. Let's verify: 77 - 36 = 41, and 41 + 4 = 45.
So the equation that works is 77 - 36 + 4.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 36 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to find an equation that uses the numbers 27, 96, and 23 exactly once to get 92. Let's start by checking if we can multiply and then subtract or add to reach 92.
96 - 27 = 69
This is not 92, so let's try a different order.
96 - 23 = 73
This is still not 92, so let's try division.
Now, let's try a different approach: 96 - 27 + 23 = 92.
96 - 27 = 69
69 + 23 = 92
</think>
<answer> 96 - 27 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 28, 49, and 5. We need to use each exactly once to get the result of 72.
- We can start by adding 28 and 49, which gives us 77.
- Now, we need to get from 77 to 72. We can do this by subtracting 5.
So, the calculation will be: 28 + 49 - 5 = 72.
</think>
<answer> 28 + 49 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 84, 15, and 44 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 84 - 15 - 44 = 25
- 84 - 15 + 44 = 113
- 84 + 15 - 44 = 55
I see that 84 + 15 - 44 does indeed equal 55. So the equation using all numbers once is 84 + 15 - 44 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 84 + 15 - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 44, 11, and 16. We need to create an equation that equals 71 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the target number 71 and the numbers given. Noticing that 44 + 16 = 60, we can then look at the remaining 11. If we take 60 and add 11, we get 71, which is what we want.
So the equation could be (44 + 16) + 11 = 71.
</think>
<answer> (44 + 16) + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 71, 6, and 43. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 19 using basic arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this could be to try to make use of the larger number first, as they can quickly bring the result to a reasonable value.
- Adding or subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger number or trying multiplication or division might help.
- Let's try: 71 - 6 - 43 = 22
- This is close but not 19. Also, 22 is not equal to 19.
- Let's try another combination: 71 - 6 + 43 = 112
- This goes in the wrong direction and is too large.
- Now, let's try combining them differently: (71 + 43) - 6 = 108 - 6 = 102
- This is also too large.
- Let's try: 71 - (6 + 43) = 71 - 49 = 22
- Still, this doesn't give us 19.
- Finally, let's try: 71 - 43 + 6 = 28 - 6 = 22
- This is still not 19.
- Now, let me try reorganizing: 71 - 43 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18
- Getting even closer but still not 19. Let me try one last time: (71 + 43) / 6 = 114 / 6 = 19
- This works! We've got 19.
</think>
<answer> (71 + 43) / 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers and operations we can use: 91, 77, 50, +, -, *, /. We need to create an equation that results in 64 using each number exactly once.
We can start by considering subtraction to potentially get a manageable number to work with:
91 - 77 = 14
Now we have 14 and 50 left, and we need to reach 64. We can try adding 50 to 14:
14 + 50 = 64
So the numbers 91, 77, and 50 can be used to make 64 by the equation:
14 + 50 = 64
However, 14 is not one of our original numbers. We know 91 - 77 = 14, so the correct equation using the original numbers would be:
91 - 77 + 50 = 64
</think>
<answer> 91 - 77 + 50 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 86, 87, and 39. We need to create an equation that results in 38 using all three numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones to see if we can get close to 38.
If we subtract 39 from 86, we get 47. This is very close to 38.
Next, we can subtract 87 from 47, but that doesn't seem to help, since it's negative and we need a positive result.
Let's try another approach: we can subtract 87 from 86, which gives -1. This doesn't work either.
Now, let's try: (86 - 87) + 39. This simplifies to -1 + 39 = 38.
So the equation is (86 - 87) + 39 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 87) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 76, 14, and 4 that equals 66. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trying 76 - 14 - 4 = 58 (not 66)
- Trying 76 - 14 + 4 = 66 (this could work)
- Trying 76 * 14 / 4 = 269 (not 66)
- Trying 76 / 14 + 4 = 7. 07142857... (not 66)
The combination 76 - 14 + 4 indeed equals 66.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 14 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the operations and what we know: we have the numbers 51, 28, and 96 to use once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 17. We can try different combinations:
- Let's see if we can combine 51 and 28 first. Their sum is 79, and their difference is 23. Neither gives us 17.
- Now let's try the difference between 96 and 28, which is 68, and then subtract 51 from it. That gives us 17.
So, the equation would be 96 - 28 - 51 = 17.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 28 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 42, 67, 8, and 6 exactly once to get 23. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One potential combination is to use subtraction:
67 - 42 = 25
Now we need a way to get from 25 to 23 using the remaining numbers 8 and 6. We can try:
25 - 8 + 6 = 23
This gives us our result. So the equation would be 67 - 42 - 8 + 6 = 23.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 42 - 8 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation using the numbers 42, 67, 8, and 6 that equals 23. Let's try combining some of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
- If I try 42 - 67, I get -25, which is not 23.
- Adding 8 and 6 gives 14. If I subtract this from 42, I get 28, which is far from 23.
- Let's try 67 - 42 + 8. This gives 33 + 8 = 41, which is still not 23.
- Perhaps I can use 67 - 42 - 8. This results in 35 - 8 = 27, which is still not 23.
- Now, let's try rearranging with 67 - 42 + 8 - 6. This simplifies to 35 + 8 - 6 = 43 - 6 = 37, not 23.
- Finally, let's try 67 - 42 - 8 + 6. This reduces to 25 - 8 + 6 = 17 + 6 = 23, which is what we need.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 42 - 8 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 39, 96, and 89 that equals 46. I should consider the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trying combinations with addition and subtraction: 96 + 89 - 39 = 185 - 39 = 146 (not 46)
- Trying combinations with multiplication and division: 96 / (89 - 39) = 96 / 50 = 1. 92 (not 46)
- Now, let's try 96 - 89 + 39: Since 96 - 89 = 7, then 7 + 39 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 89 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 39, 96, and 89 that equals 46. I should look for combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Looking at the numbers, 96 - 89 = 7. Now if I use 39 - 7, I get 32, which is not 46. But adding 7 to 39 gives 46, which is what we want. So the equation becomes 39 + (96 - 89) = 46.
</think>
<answer> 39 + (96 - 89) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 49, 52, and 35. We need to create an equation that equals 66 using each of these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the difference between 52 and 35, which is 17. Then we need to add 49 to this difference to get 66.
So the equation would be 52 - 35 + 49 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 35 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 17, 36, and 34. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to make the equation equal to 87.
One way to approach this is to see how we can combine these numbers using arithmetic operations. Let's try adding some numbers and then subtracting others.
17 + 36 = 53
Now we need something that will add 34 to this sum to get to 87. We can calculate: 53 + 34 = 87.
So, the equation can be (17 + 36) + 34 = 87.
</think>
<answer> (17 + 36) + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the three numbers we have: 17, 36, and 34. We need to use each exactly once to make the equation equal to 87.
We can start by checking if we can combine any of the numbers to reach closer to 87. Adding 36 and 34 gives us 70, which is close to 87. Now we need 17 more to reach 87.
So, 36 + 34 + 17 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 36 + 34 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 44, 8, and 33 exactly once to make an equation equal to 69. Let's try different combinations with the arithmetic operations.
One approach could be: \( 44 + 8 + 33 \)
Let's calculate this: 
\( 44 + 8 + 33 = 86 \), which doesn't equal 69.
Another approach could be: \( 44 + 33 - 8 \)
Let's calculate this:
\( 44 + 33 - 8 = 71 \), which is close but still not 69.
Another approach is to consider operations on pairs first: \( 44 - 33 + 8 \)
Let's calculate this: 
\( 44 - 33 + 8 = 9 \), which is still not 69.
Now, let's try \( (44 - 33) * 8 \)
\( 44 - 33 = 11 \)
\( 11 * 8 = 88 \), which is too high.
Another approach is to try \( 44 + (33 - 8) \)
\( 33 - 8 = 25 \)
\( 44 + 25 = 69 \), this equals 69.
So the equation is \( 44 + (33 - 8) \). </think>
<answer> 44 + (33 - 8) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 47, and 61 that equals 51. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One combination that could work is using subtraction and addition:
61 - 57 + 47 = 51
Now let's verify this:
61 - 57 equals 4
4 + 47 equals 51
This is correct, so the equation is:
61 - 57 + 47 = 51
</think>
<answer> 61 - 57 + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 50, and 6. We need to use each exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the result of 50.
One approach could be to consider if the number 50 can be broken down. Since 50 is a simple number, we can think if adding or subtracting the other numbers can give us 50.
If we add 6 and 6, we get 12, which is not 50.
If we try 50 - 6, we get 44, which is still not 50.
If we consider multiplication, we have 6 * 6 = 36, which is still not 50.
Lastly, let's try 50 - (6 + 6). Simplifying inside the parentheses first gives us 50 - 12, which equals 38, not 50.
Now, let's try taking 50 and expressing it by adding and subtracting the numbers in a different way. Notice that:
(50 - 6) + 6 = 44 + 6
This doesn't work either.
Now, we can try another combination: 50 - (6 + 6/6). Here, we first do the division: 6/6 = 1, then add it: 6 + 1 = 7. Finally, we subtract this from 50: 50 - 7 = 43, which is still not 50.
Finally, we should also consider the combination 6 + (50 - 6):
6 + (50 - 6) = 6 + 44 = 50.
This combination results in 50.
</think>
<answer> 6 + (50 - 6)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 13, and 55 that equals 27. One way to achieve this is by combining 95 and 55 to get 150, and then use that result to subtract 13. Let's verify this:
1. First, I'll add 95 and 55: 95 + 55 = 150
2. Next, I'll subtract 13 from 150: 150 - 13 = 137
This gives us the number 137, not 27. Therefore, the direct addition and subtraction approach doesn't work here. Let's think of another combination.
If I subtract 55 from 95, I get 40. Then, I need to subtract 13 from 40 to get 27: 95 - 55 - 13 = 27.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 55 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 18, 44, and 3 that equals 23. I'll try to combine them with basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that if I subtract 3 from 18, I get 15. Then if I add 44 to 15, I get 59, which is too high.
Instead, let's try multiplying 3 by 3 and then add 44. That would be 3 * 3 = 9, and 9 + 44 = 53, which is still too high.
Now, let's try a different combination: 44 - 18 = 26. If I add 3 to 26, I get 29, which is close but still too high.
Let's reverse the numbers: 3 * 18 = 54, and subtract 44 from 54. That gives 10. Clearly, this is not correct.
Instead, let's try: 44 - (3 * 18) = 44 - 54 = -10. Not correct.
I haven't tried performing operations on each number with the other two numbers yet. Let's try 18 + (44 / 3) = 18 + 14 = 32, which is too high.
Now I'll try: (44 / 3) + 18 = 14 + 18 = 32, which is too high.
Finally, I will try: (3 * 18) - 44 = 54 - 44 = 10, which is too low.
None of the above worked. I need to try another combination, such as: 44 - 18 + 3 = 44 - 15 = 29, which is still too high.
I'll now try: 3 + (18 - 44) = 3 - 26 = -23, which is too low.
Finally, I will try this: (3 * 18) - (44 / 3) = 54 - 14 = 40, which is too high.
I have to try something different. Let's try: (44 - 18) - 3 = 26 - 3 = 23. This yields the correct result.
Thus, the equation is (44 - 18) - 3 = 23.
</think>
<answer> (44 - 18) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 18, 44, and 3 that equals 23. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One combination could be 44 - 18 + 3. 
Let's calculate this:
44 - 18 = 26
26 + 3 = 29
This is close to 23, but not quite right. 
Now let's try another combination: 44 - 3 - 18
Let's calculate this:
44 - 3 = 41
41 - 18 = 23
This gives us the desired result of 23, using each of the numbers only once.
</think>
<answer> 44 - 3 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers available: 8, 27, and 51. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations to get 32.
Considering the target number 32, we can start with simple additions or subtractions. If we take 27 and 51, their sum is 78, which is way too high. If we subtract, 51 - 27 = 24, still not 32.
Now let's think about 8, a much smaller number. If we use 8, we should look for combinations that, when combined with 27 and/or 51, give us 32.
One possibility is 51 - 27 = 24, then subtracting 8 from 24 would not give us 32, so we should look at 51 + 27 = 78, which is too much.
Another approach could be combining 8 and 27. The difference of 8 from 27 = 19. Now, adding 8 to this result:
8 + (51 - 27) = 8 + 24 = 32.
Thus, the equation is 8 + (51 - 27).
</think>
<answer> 8 + (51 - 27) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 95, 68, 15, and 23 exactly once to equal 19. Let's look at the numbers and consider basic operations.
If we subtract 68 from 95, we get 27. Now we have 27 and 15, and we need to get to 19.
If we then subtract 15 from 27, we get 12. We're still not at 19, so we need to use the last number, 23.
Instead of adding or subtracting 23 from 12, we can try multiplying. Multiplying 12 by 23 gives us 276, which is too large. Instead, let's try another approach.
What if we use division here? If we take 15 and divide it by 68, we get a small fraction. But, if we take 15 divided by 68 and then add to the 23, and subtract from 95, we can get the right number.
Let's test: 95 - (15 / 68) - 23
This simplifies to: 95 - (0. 2206) - 23
This further simplifies to: 71. 7794
This isn't right, so let's try another approach.
Let's try: (95 - 68) - 23 + 15
This simplifies to: 27 - 23 + 15
This further simplifies to: 4 + 15
This simplifies to: 19
So, our equation that works is (95 - 68 - 23 + 15) = 19.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 68 - 23 + 15) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 39, and 1 to get the result of 15. Let's try different combinations of the operations and numbers.
One way to approach this is:
- Start with the smallest number, 1.
- Try adding 39 to it: 1 + 39 = 40, which is too high.
- Now try adding 53 to 1: 53 + 1 = 54, which is still too high.
- Consider subtracting: If I subtract 39 from 53: 53 - 39 = 14, which is closer but still not 15.
- Finally, try subtracting 1 from 53: 53 - 1 = 52, which is still not 15.
- Now think about multiplying or dividing. Multiplying 1 by any of the other numbers doesn't seem to help get to 15.
- Last trial: 39 - 53 + 1 = -13, which is too low.
None of the mixed operations seem to work, so I try another combination with a different starting strategy.
Consider re-arranging the operations:
39 - 53 + 1 isn't quite right, but notice that rearranging the terms 53 - 39 + 1 would equal 54 - 39 = 15, which is incorrect.
Consider the correct arrangement of 1 + 53 - 39 should give the target result:
(1 + 53) - 39 = 54 - 39 = 15
</think>
<answer> (1 + 53) - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 43, 34, and 39 exactly once to make 38. Let's start by subtracting a smaller number from a larger one to get closer to 38.
43 - 39 = 4 (this is not 38)
Now let's try 39 - 34 = 5
That's not correct either but it gives us closer to 38.
What if we use 43 - 34 + 39?
43 - 34 = 9
9 + 39 = 48 (too big)
Next, let's try 39 - 34 + 43:
39 - 34 = 5
5 + 43 = 48 (still too big)
It seems I missed the combination that works. Let's try combinations in a different order:
34 - 39 + 43:
34 - 39 = -5
-5 + 43 = 38
This combination works correctly.
</think>
<answer> 34 - 39 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 37, 51, and 72 that equals 58. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to do this could be 72 - 51 + 37. Let's evaluate this expression:
72 - 51 = 21
21 + 37 = 58
So the equation 72 - 51 + 37 equals 58.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 51 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 2, 45, and 35 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to result in 82.
Looking at the numbers, it seems 45 - 35 = 10, which is not 82. So I need to think of a way to incorporate 2 into the equation.
If I add 2 to 45, I get 47. Then if I take that result and add 35, I get 82.
So the equation would be: 45 + 2 + 35 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 2 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 25, 49, and 12. We need to create an equation that equals 86 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by adding 25 and 12, which gives us 37. Now we need 49 more to reach 86.
37 + 49 = 86.
So, the equation is 25 + 12 + 49.
</think>
<answer> 25 + 12 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 12, 73, and 49. We need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to get the result 36.
- Start by comparing the difference between 73 and 49, which is 24. This difference is quite large, so it might be helpful to reduce the sum of the remaining numbers.
- The sum of the numbers 12 and 49 is 61. If we subtract 73 from this sum, we get:
  61 - 73 = -12.
- Now we have -12 and 12. Rearranging these, we get 12 - (-12) = 12 + 12 = 24.
- Now we need to incorporate the 73. We can do this by adding and subtracting in a way that allocates the 73. We can try:
  73 + (12 - 49) = 73 + (-37) = 73 - 37 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 73 + (12 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 58, 49, and 73. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get the result 64.
One way to approach this is to look for two numbers whose difference is close to 64, and the third number can be used to adjust.
Looking at the numbers:
73 - 49 = 24
We are far from 64, so let's try another combination.
58 - 49 = 9
Now 64 - 9 = 55, and adding 73 gives 128 which is too much, so this isn't the right combination.
Let's try another combination:
73 + 58 = 131 (too much)
73 + 49 = 122 (still too much)
58 + 49 = 107 (still too much)
Let's try 58 * (73 - 49)
58 * (73 - 49) = 58 * 24 = 1392 (way too much)
Ah, let me try 73 - (58 / 49):
73 - (58 / 49) = 73 - 1. 1837 (approximately) = 71. 8163. This is close but not quite 64.
Finally, by trying:
(73 + 49) - 58
We get: (73 + 49) - 58 = 122 - 58 = 64.
</think>
<answer>(73 + 49) - 58</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 37, 27, and 29 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get the result 35.
I see that if I subtract 37 and 27, I get 10. Then, if I subtract 29 from this result, I get:
37 + 27 - 29 = 35
So the equation is 37 + 27 - 29.
</think>
<answer> 37 + 27 - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 37, 27, and 29. We need to create an equation using these numbers that equals 35. One way to approach this is to check if any of the numbers are close to 35 or if their combination using arithmetic operations can lead us to 35.
Let's check if 37 - 27 + 29 = 35.
37 - 27 = 10
10 + 29 = 39
This is not 35, so this combination doesn't work.
Next, let's check if we can use the numbers in a different way. We know 37 - 29 = 8 and if we can make anything with 27 and 8, that might do it. Let's check:
27 + 8 would be 35.
Thus, we can create the equation: 27 + (37 - 29) = 35.
</think>
<answer> 27 + (37 - 29) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 67, 63, and 22. We need to use each exactly once to get an equation that equals 18.
If we look at the operations, we can try to use subtraction to make some numbers closer to 18.
67 - 63 = 4
Now we have 4 and 22 left. If we add 4 and 22:
4 + 22 = 26
Adding this result to the remaining 63 doesn't get us to 18. Let's try another combination.
67 - 22 = 45
Then we need to subtract 45 from 63 to get to 18:
63 - 45 = 18
So we have used 67, 22, and subtracted 45 (which came from 67 - 22) to get 18.
</think>
<answer> 63 - (67 - 22) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 20, 31, and 28 exactly once to equal 23. I can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 31 - 28 + 20
31 - 28 = 3
Then 3 + 20 = 23
So the equation is 31 - 28 + 20 = 23.
</think>
<answer> 31 - 28 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the possible combinations of the numbers 23, 77, and 26 using basic arithmetic operations. We need an equation that equals 80.
We can try different operations:
- Adding and subtracting: (23 + 77) - 26 = 100 - 26 = 74, which is not 80.
- Multiplying and adding: 23 * 77 + 26 would be too large ( = 1771 + 26 = 1797), and 77 * 26 + 23 would be too small ( = 1962 + 23 = 1985).
- Multiplying and subtracting: There's no obvious combination that fits.
- Trying with division: (77 - 23) / 26 would give us 54 / 26, which isn't 80.
- Combining subtraction and addition: 77 - 23 + 26 = 54 + 26 = 80.
So, after trying these combinations, we find that the equation 77 - 23 + 26 equals 80.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 23 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 23, 77, and 26. We need to create an equation that equals 80 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try to add and subtract the numbers:
23 + 77 = 100
Now, we need to get to 80. We can do this by subtracting 26 from 100:
100 - 26 = 74
This doesn't give us 80, so let's try adding and subtracting in a different order:
77 + 26 = 103
Then, subtract 23:
103 - 23 = 80
So, we have our equation: 77 + 26 - 23 = 80.
</think>
<answer> 77 + 26 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 20, and 50. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 21.
- We see that 51 - 50 = 1. This is close, but not exactly 21.
- Adding or subtracting other pairs won't get us to 21 either.
- However, if we take the larger number, 51, and subtract the sum of the other two, we can achieve the desired result.
- 51 - (20 + 50) = 51 - 70 = -19, which is not 21.
- Let's try the next logical step: (51 - 50) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21.
Thus, the equation that equals 21 is (51 - 50) + 20.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 50) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 79, and 43 that results in 59. One way to approach this is to consider operations that can reduce or combine these numbers efficiently.
Let's try different combinations:
- 95 - 79 = 16
- 16 + 43 = 59
This gives us the equation: 95 - 79 + 43 = 59
Now, I will verify if this satisfies the condition:
95 - 79 + 43 = 59
56 + 43 = 59
59 = 59
This is correct, as it satisfies the equation.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 79 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 87, 38, and 27 exactly once to result in 98. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing the numbers might give us the result.
- We should consider both possible orders of operations (left to right or prioritizing specific operations).
Let's try the combination: 87 - 38 + 27
- Start with 87 - 38 = 49
- Then, 49 + 27 = 76
This isn't the answer we're looking for. Let's try another approach:
- Trying 87 + 38 - 27:
- Start with 87 + 38 = 125
- Then, 125 - 27 = 98
This combination gives us the answer 98.
</think>
<answer> 87 + 38 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 2, 2, 24, and 9. We need to form an equation that results in 29.
One approach could be to consider multiplication and addition. We see that 24 + 5 would be 29, but our only available number that isn't already used is 2 or 9. We can use these to get 5.
Notice that 9 - 2 = 7, and then 2 * 7 = 14, but we need 5, not 14.
However, if we rearrange it slightly, we can form 24 - 2 + 3. But 3 is not in our set of numbers. 
Instead, let's try 24 - (9 / 2). Here we divide 9 by 2 to get 4.5, and subtract this from 24 which gives us 19.5.
We're not there yet, but we've gotten close by using all numbers once. Now we need 10 more to reach 29. 
We have not tried using 2 yet. Notice we need 10 more since 24 - 4.5 = 19. 5 and subtraction of 5 achieves this. So 24 - 2 = 22, then 22 - 3 = 19.  Now we need 10 more, and 2 * 5 = 10.
Adding everything together: 24 - 2 + 5 = 27 which isn't 29.
Now, 2 * 5 = 10, so 24 - 2 + 9 - 2 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 24 - 2 + 9 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 93, 82, 74, and 37 exactly once to equal 100. Let's start by combining the smaller numbers since they will be easier to work with towards our goal.
If I add 37 and 63 (by subtracting 74 from 141, but since 141 isn't available, I'll use another strategy), I get 100.
Instead, let's try another approach. If I subtract 74 from 177 (by adding 93 and 82), I get 103. However, 103 is too big.
Let me try 82 + 18 (74 - 93), but 18 isn't an available number. Let's stick to the current numbers then.
I notice if I take 93 and subtract 74 (which is the largest difference I can make using the other two numbers 82 and 37), I get 19. Now I need 81 more to reach 100.
I see that 82 - 37 = 45, and then 19 + 45 = 64. I now need 36 more to reach 100.
I realize I can use 37 again but subtracting 74 to get -37, which doesn't help. My current approach isn't working smoothly.
Then, I notice (93 + 74) - 82 + 37 = 164 - 82 + 37 = 82 + 37 = 119, which is too much.
Finally, I realize using 93 + (82 - 74) + 37 = 93 + 8 - 7 = 94 + 37 = 131. This is still too much.
By refining it, 93 + (82 - 74) + 37 = 93 + 8 + 37 = 138. Not good.
After several trials, I find the solution:
82 + 74 - 93 + 37 = 100. Let's check this:
82 + 74 = 156
156 - 93 = 63
63 + 37 = 100.
This indeed works.
</think>
<answer> 82 + 74 - 93 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 9, 63, and 39. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using the arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 93.
- One way to approach this is to look for a combination where multiplication can produce a big number quickly.
- 63 * 39 initially seems promising because 63 * 39 = 2457, which is too large for our target.
- Let's try subtracting 63 from 39 and then adding 9:
  - 39 - 63 = -24
  - -24 + 9 = -15 (This doesn't work as it's not 93)
- Next, let's try subtracting 9 from 63 and then adding 39:
  - 63 - 9 = 54
  - 54 + 39 = 93 (This works!)
So the equation that equals 93 using the numbers 9, 63, and 39 is 63 - 9 + 39.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 9 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 29, 87, and 21. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) that equals 95.
Looking at the numbers, we can observe that 87 - 29 = 58, but this is not close to 95. Let's try another combination.
Next, consider the combination 87 - 21 + 29. This gives us:
\[ 87 - 21 + 29 = 66 + 29 = 95 \]
So, the equation is 87 - 21 + 29 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 21 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 43, and 35. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 61.
One approach is to see if we can subtract or add numbers in a way that gets us close to 61 and then adjust with another operation.
If we subtract 35 from 69, we get 34.
If we add 43 to 34, we get 77, which is too high.
If instead, we subtract 43 from 69, we get 26.
Then to get to 61, we need to add 35 to 26, but since we have already used 35 as a starting point, we need to adjust.
Now let's try combining them differently: If we use multiplication and addition, 69 * 0. 5 gives us 34.5, which is not an integer and can't work as is, but 69 - 43 + 35 gives us 61.
This combination seems to fit our criteria.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 43 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 73, and 4. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once such that the result is 32.
We need to explore different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we multiply 45 by 4, we get 180, which is too large.
If we divide 73 by 4, we get 18.25, which is not a whole number, and obviously, we can't use fractions in our equation.
Let's try another combination: 73 - 45 gives us 28, and then we try to get 4 from this or from 4. We are left with 4 and 28. By doing 28 - 4, we get 24, still not 32.
Now, let's try a different order: 73 - 45 = 28, and then we need 4 more to get to 32. We need 32 - 28 = 4, which can be achieved by using 4 directly. So, the equation becomes 73 - 45 + 4.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 45 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 15, 7, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations to get the result of 50.
We can start with the larger number, 15, and see if we can form 50 using the other numbers. If we subtract 7 from 15, we get 8. Then, if we multiply 8 by 5, we get 40. This is close to 50, so we need an additional 10. Since we cannot add or subtract to get 10 directly, we might need to consider division or multiplication differently.
Now, if we take 15 and 7, we can see that 15 - 7 = 8. We can then take 8 and multiply it by 5 (15 * 7 / 3) which indeed equals 35. However, this doesn't get us to 50. Let's try another combination. 15 + 7 = 22, and if we take 22 and multiply by (5/1) = 5, we don't get 50.
Given the numbers and the operations available, let's combine them as follows: (15 - 7) * 5 + 15 / 1. This gives us: (8) * 5 + 15 / 1, which equals 40 + 15 = 55, not 50.
Finally, let's check 15 * 7 - 5: 15 * 7 equals 105, and subtracting 5 from 105 gives 100, not 50. 
Upon rechecking all possible combinations: (15 - 7) * 5 + 15 / 1 doesn't quite fit as expected. The potential clear attempt is 15 * 7 - 5 = 105 - 5 = 100, which doesn't work either.
Considering again:
(15 + 7) * 5 / 1 provides (22 * 5) / 1, giving 110 / 1 = 110 (not 50).
The correct calculation approach is (15 * 7 - 5) = 105 - 5 = 100 which isn't correct.
There seems a miscalculation, before letting's reconsider 15 + (5 * 7) equals 15 + 35 = 50!
Indeed, 15 + 35 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 15 + (5 * 7) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 38, 21, and 59 using basic arithmetic operations that result in 42. 
Starting with the numbers given, let's see if there's any obvious combination:
- 38 + 21 = 59
- 59 - 38 = 21
- 59 - 21 = 38
None of these add or subtract directly to 42. Next, let's try multiplication and division:
- 38 * 21 / 59 isn't close to 42
- 38 * 59 / 21 isn't 42
- 21 * 59 / 38 isn't 42 either
Given these computations don't work out, let's try a different combination:
- (59 - 21) + 38 = 38 + 38 = 76, not 42
- (59 - 38) + 21 = 21 + 21 = 42, this looks promising.
So the equation 59 - 38 + 21 equals 42. </think>
<answer> (59 - 38) + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 38, 21, and 59 that equals 42. I should consider all the basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
One approach is to use the numbers as they are and perform operations on them. Let's try the equation: 59 - 38 + 21
Let's check if that equals 42:
59 - 38 = 21
21 + 21 = 42
This equation works because 59 - 38 + 21 = 42.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 38 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 34, 54, and 17. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 71.
Let's try different combinations:
- Adding and subtracting: (34 + 54) - 17 = 88 - 17 = 71
- Multiplying and adding: 34 * 54 / 17 is not a simple way to reach 71
- Using fractions: (54 - 34) / 17 is not close to 71
From the combinations tried, the equation (34 + 54) - 17 equals 71.
</think>
<answer>(34 + 54) - 17</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 93, 7, and 2 that equals 84. I'll start by looking at the numbers and trying to combine them in different ways with the arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider subtraction and multiplication. If I subtract 7 and 2 from 93, I get:
93 - 7 - 2 = 84
So the equation that uses the numbers 93, 7, and 2 once each to make 84 is 93 - 7 - 2.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 7 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 85, 27, and 9. We need to use these numbers exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations to get 67.
We can start by looking at the larger numbers first. If we subtract 27 from 85, we get 58. Now our numbers are 9 and 58.
Adding 9 to 58 gives us 67. So the equation would be:
85 - 27 + 9 = 67
</think>
<answer> 85 - 27 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 21, and 86 that equals 77, with each number used only once. One way to approach this is to try combining the numbers through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's start by looking at the numbers:
30 + 21 + 86 = 137 (too large)
30 + 86 - 21 = 95 (too large)
30 * 86 / 21 = 120.95 (not an integer and not 77)
Now let's try another combination:
(86 - 21) + 30 = 65 (not 77)
Let's try another:
86 + (30 * 21 / 100) = 86 + 6.3 = 92.3 (not 77)
Finally, let's try:
(86 - 30) + 21 = 57 + 21 = 78 (not 77)
I see a mistake here - I forgot to consider all possible operations and placements. Let me try:
21 + 86 - 30 = 77
This gives us the correct result.
</think>
<answer> 21 + 86 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 49, 39, and 97. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using each number exactly once and only using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the operations we can use:
- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
Let's try to place the numbers in different positions and see if we can get the result 87.
If we take 97 and subtract 39, we get 58. Now we need 29 more to reach 87.
Then we subtract 49 from 58 which gives us 9. But adding 9 to 87 gives us 96, not 87.
Instead, let's try the equation: 97 - 39 + 49.
This gives us: 97 - 39 = 58, then 58 + 49 = 107.
That's too much. Let's switch the order: 97 - 49 + 39.
This gives us: 97 - 49 = 48, then 48 + 39 = 87.
So the equation is correct: 97 - 49 + 39 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 49 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 49, 39, and 97. We need to use all of them to make 87.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations. We notice that 97 - 49 = 48 and 39 + 48 = 87.
So, the equation that works is 39 + (97 - 49) = 87.
</think>
<answer> 39 + (97 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the possible combinations of the numbers 79, 14, and 9 using basic arithmetic operations. We need to achieve the result of 74.
1. 79 - 14 - 9 = 56 (We're short by 18)
2. 79 - 14 + 9 = 74 (This is close and uses all numbers)
3. 79 - (14 + 9) = 56 (We're short by 18 again)
4. 79 + 14 - 9 = 84 (We're over by 10)
5. 79 + (14 - 9) = 84 (We're over by 10)
6. (79 - 9) + 14 = 84 (We're over by 10)
From the above combinations, we can see that 79 - 14 + 9 = 74 utilizes all the numbers exactly once and equals 74.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 14 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 87, 24, and 58 that equals 53. I'll start by checking if I can get close to 53 with any basic combination of these numbers.
87 - 24 - 58 does not equal 53.
58 + 24 - 87 does not work either.
Trying 87 - 58 + 24 does not yield 53.
What if I rearrange the operations? 58 - 24 + 87?
This does give me 58 - 24, which is 34, and then adding 87 results in 121. That's too big.
Now, let's try a different order: 87 - 58 - 24 = 87 - 82 = 5. 
Now we can use the remaining 24 and 58 to make 53. By subtracting 5 from 58 and adding 24 we get 53.
(87 - 58) + (24 + 58) = 29 + 58 = 53.
But there's an easier way using the numbers directly as described: 87 - 58 + 24 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 58 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 1, and 21. We need an equation that equals 26 using these numbers only once.
- We can try combining the numbers with basic arithmetic operations to see if we can reach the target number.
- Let's start with 46 - 21 = 25. This is close but not exactly 26.
- If we add 1 to 25, we get 26. So, 46 - 21 + 1 = 26.
- This solution uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 46 - 21 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 43, 85, and 47 that equals 81. Let's try different combinations of operations.
If we look at these numbers, one combination that might work is: 85 - 47 + 43. Let's check if it equals 81.
So, 85 - 47 = 38, and then 38 + 43 = 81.
That works! So the equation is 85 - 47 + 43.
</think>
<answer> 85 - 47 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 96, 34, 15, and 86 exactly once to get 59. Let's start by checking if any straightforward operations can yield this result. Subtracting 86 from 96 gives 10. Adding 34 to 10 would give 44, which is not 59. Subtracting 34 from 96 gives 62, and then adding 15 would give 77, which is too high. Let's try another combination: Adding 34 to 15 gives 49. Then, if we subtract 15 from 96, we get 81. Finally, subtracting 81 from 49 would give -32, which is not 59. So, we need another approach. If we take 96 and subtract 86, we get 10. Now, if we add 34 to 10, we get 44. We still need 15 more to reach 59. Let's check if combining 44 and 15 would work: 44 + 15 = 59. This works! Now we need to represent this with the original numbers. The steps can be represented as: (96 - 86) + 34 + 15 = 59.
</think>
<answer> (96 - 86) + 34 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 41, 68, and 54. We need to arrange these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 81. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try 68 + 54 - 41:
68 + 54 = 122
122 - 41 = 81
So, the equation using the numbers 41, 68, and 54 that equals 81 is 68 + 54 - 41.
</think>
<answer> 68 + 54 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We need to form an equation using the numbers 31, 22, and 42 exactly once, which equals 95.
We can start by checking if multiplication and addition/subtraction can work:
31 * 42 = 1302 (which is too large)
42 * 22 = 924 (which is also too large)
Let's try combinations of addition and subtraction:
31 + 22 + 42 = 95 (This works as it equals 95)
So, we have found a valid equation: 31 + 22 + 42 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 31 + 22 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 6, and 70 that equals 54. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 70 - 22 = 48, which is close to 54. If I can get 6 to be used in a way that will give me the remaining 6, I might find the solution.
If I take 70 - 22 = 48 and add 6, I get 48 + 6 = 54, which is exactly what I need.
So the equation will be: 70 - 22 + 6 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 22 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 49, 52, and 36. We need to use each number exactly once and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to make the equation equal to 65.
One possibility is to use multiplication and addition:
52 * 36 = 1872
Now, we need a number that, when combined with 49 through addition or subtraction, will give us 65.
1872 - 1807 = 65
Since 1872 is too large, let's try another approach:
49 + 52 = 101
101 - 36 = 65
This equation equals 65, and we have used each of the given numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 49 + 52 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 49, 52, and 36. We need to use these numbers once each to produce an equation that equals 65.
- 52 - 36 = 16
- Now we need 49 to get to 65 from 16. We can add 49 to 16:
- 16 + 49 = 65
So the equation is 52 - 36 + 49 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 36 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 20, 69, and 22 using basic arithmetic operations to get 67. Let's try different combinations:
- Adding and subtracting: 20 + 69 + 22 = 111 (too high)
- Subtraction and addition: 69 - 20 - 22 = 27 (too low)
- Multiplication and addition: 20 * 69 + 22 = 1382 (too high)
- Combination of operations: (69 + 22) - 20 = 61 (still too low)
- Another combination: (69 + 20) - 22 = 67 (this works)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 20, 69, and 22 exactly once and equals 67 is (69 + 20) - 22.
</think>
<answer> (69 + 20) - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 25, 85, and 95 that equals 35. Let's consider different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trying combinations like 85 - 95 + 25 doesn't work as it equals -50.
- 25 + (85 / 95) isn't an integer, so that doesn't work either.
- Let's try 95 - 85 + 25 = 35, which seems promising.
This combination gives us 35, and using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 85 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 25, 85, and 95 exactly once to get the result 35. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we start with 95 - 85, we get 10. Now we need 25 + 10, which gives us 35.
So, the equation is 95 - 85 + 25 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 85 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 96, and 26. We need to create an equation that equals 97 using each number exactly once.
- We can start by looking at the difference between 96 and 26, which is 96 - 26 = 70.
- Now we have 27 and 70, and we need 20 more to reach 97 (because 97 - 27 = 70).
- Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to get 20 directly from 27 and 70 using basic arithmetic operations.
- However, we can reformulate the equation. Notice that 96 - 26 = 70. If we subtract 70 from 97, we get 97 - 70 = 27.
- This doesn't work directly, but let's consider adding a negative value that could balance out. Notice that 97 - 70 = 27, but we need to include 26 as well.
- So we can rewrite it as (96 - 26) + 27, which simplifies to 70 + 27, and that equals 97.
</think>
<answer> (96 - 26) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 62, 54, and 56. We need to create an equation that equals 60 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
62 - 54 = 8
56 - 8 = 48
This doesn't give us 60. Next, let's try combining them in a different way:
62 + 56 = 118
54 - 56 = -2
This also doesn't work as we're not getting 60. Let's try another sequence:
54 - 56 = -2
62 - (-2) = 64
This is far from 60. It seems like we need to try rearranging and applying operations:
62 + 54 = 116
56 - 54 = 2
116 - 54 = 62
Still off by 38. Trying another combination:
54 + 56 = 110
62 - 110 = -48
Not right. Finally, let's try:
(62 - 56) + 54 = 6
But we need to consider if there's a combination of operations to make it 60:
62 + 54 - 56 = 60
This works as 62 + 54 = 116 and then 116 - 56 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 62 + 54 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 45, 5, and 48. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get a result of 88 using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider if any combination of these numbers, using addition and subtraction, can add up to 88.
If we start by adding 45 and 48, we get 93. Then if we subtract 5 from 93, we get 88.
So, the equation would be: 45 + 48 - 5 = 88.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 48 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 90, 85, and 30. We need to create an equation that equals 35 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by trying to subtract numbers:
90 - 85 = 5
This doesn't get us closer to 35.
Then let's try combining 90 and 30:
90 + 30 = 120
This is too large.
Now let's try:
90 - 30 = 60
This is still not 35.
Let's try multiplication and division:
85 * 30 = 2550 (which is not 35)
90 * 30 = 2700 (also not 35)
85 / 30 = 2. 83 (not an integer and not 35)
Now, let's try mixing subtraction and addition:
90 - 85 + 30 = 35
This works, using each number exactly once and adding and subtracting properly.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 85) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 44, 94, and 90. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 40 using basic arithmetic operations.
- If we try to subtract: 94 - 90 = 4, which is close to 40 but not quite there.
- Multiplying or dividing won't immediately reach 40 from 44 and 94, so let's try combinations.
- Let's try: 94 - 90 + 44. This gives us 94 - 90 = 4, and then 4 + 44 = 48, which is too high.
- Let's try another combination: 94 + 90 - 44. This gives us 94 + 90 = 184, and then 184 - 44 = 140, which is also too high.
- Now, let's try: 44 - (94 - 90). Simplifying inside the parenthesis: 94 - 90 = 4, then 44 - 4 = 40. This gives us exactly 40.
So the equation is 44 - (94 - 90) which simplifies to 44 - 4 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 44 - (94 - 90) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 28, 22, 2, and 74. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 70.
One useful approach is to experiment with different arithmetic operations. If we start with subtraction, we might get closer to 70.
If we subtract 28 from 74, we get 46. Then we need to get from 46 to 70 by using the remaining numbers 22 and 2.
Adding 22 to 46 gives 68, and we need an additional 2 to reach 70. We can achieve this by adding 2 to 68.
Therefore, the calculation is: 74 - 28 + 22 + 2 = 70.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 28 + 22 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 74, 33, and 87. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to make 46 using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Looking at the numbers, if we subtract 33 from 74, we get 41. Then, if we subtract 87 from this result, we get -46. This doesn't work.
Next, let's try another approach: if we take 87 and subtract 74, we get 13. Then, if we subtract 33 from this result, we get -20. This also doesn't work.
Now, let's try multiplication and subtraction: 74 * 33 / 87. First, 74 * 33 = 2442. Then, 2442 / 87 gives us approximately 28. 18, which is not 46.
Finally, let's try a different combination: 74 - 87 + 33. This evaluates as 74 - 87 = -13, and then -13 + 33 = 20, which is still not 46.
It appears none of the above combinations quite work out. Let's try a different approach.
The closest combination that could work might be 87 - 74 + 33, which simplifies to 87 - 74 = 13, and then 13 + 33 = 46.
So, the equation would be 87 - 74 + 33 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 74 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 59, 74, and 25 that equals 56. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One combination that might work is using 74 - 59 and then doing some modification with the remaining numbers 66 and 25.
74 - 59 = 15
Now we need 41 more to reach 56 (because 56 - 15 = 41).
This can be done by 66 - 25 = 41.
So the equation is 74 - 59 + 66 - 25 = 56.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 59 + 66 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 66, 41, and 29. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 78.
Let's try different combinations:
- If we add 66 and 41, we get 107, which is too high.
- If we subtract 29 from 66, we get 37, and then adding 41 gives 78.
This combination works: (66 - 29) + 41 = 78.
</think>
<answer> (66 - 29) + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 66, 41, and 29. We need to form an equation using these numbers only once that equals 78.
Let's try combining the numbers in different ways using addition and subtraction:
66 + 41 = 107 (This is close but too big)
66 + 29 = 95 (This is still too big)
41 + 29 = 70 (This is close but still too small)
66 - 41 = 25 (This is far from 78)
29 + 41 - 66 = 14 (This is too small)
Another combination could be:
66 + 29 - 41 = 54
66 + 29 - 41 doesn't equal 78, but let's try removing the +29 and adding 66 instead:
66 + 41 - 29 = 78
Yes, this calculates to 78.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 41 - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 66, 41, and 29. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 78.
- If we add 66 and 41, we get 107, which is too high.
- If we subtract 29 from 66, we get 37, which is still too high.
- If we subtract 41 from 66, we get 25, which is still too low.
- Trying multiplication and division first, 66 * 29 = 1914, which is far too high.
- Now, let's try 66 - 41 + 29. Performing this:
  66 - 41 = 25
  25 + 29 = 54
Clearly, 54 is not 78. This approach doesn't seem to work.
- Now, let's try combining numbers differently:
  66 + 41 - 29 = 78
Calculating this:
  66 + 41 = 107
  107 - 29 = 78
This satisfies our requirement.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 41 - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 30, 37, and 8. We need to create an equation that results in 15 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's start by looking at the total we need to reach: 15.
One way to approach this is to see if we can subtract or add any of the numbers to get closer to 15. Notice that if we subtract 37 from 80 (which is 30 + 8), we get:
80 - 37 = 43
Now, let's see if we can manipulate 43 to get 15. If we subtract 28 from 43, we get:
43 - 28 = 15
Now, we need to find how to get 28 from the numbers 30 and 8. We can see that:
30 - 8 = 22
This is not correct, so we need to try a different combination.
Another way is to consider if we can divide or multiply some of these numbers to help get 28:
8 * 3. 5 = 28 (not using exact operations with the numbers)
Let's try a new approach: manipulating with basic arithmetic:
37 - 30 = 7
Now, how can we make 15 from 8 + 7?
8 + 7 = 15
So, the equation is:
8 + (37 - 30) = 15
</think>
<answer> 8 + (37 - 30) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 30, 37, and 8. We need to create an equation that equals 15 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 37 - 30 = 7, and 7 + 8 = 15, but 7 + 8 doesn't use all numbers.
- 30 + 37 = 67, which is far from 15.
- 37 + 8 - 30 = 15, which uses all numbers and gives us our target result.
Thus, the equation is 37 + 8 - 30 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 37 + 8 - 30 </answer>

<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 88, 19, and 28. We need to create an equation that equals 79 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 88 - 19 + 28 = 97 (which is too high)
- 88 - 28 + 19 = 79 (which is what we need)
Therefore, the equation is 88 - 28 + 19 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 28 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 88, 19, and 28. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 79 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can try combining 88 and 19 first to see if we get closer to 79:
88 + 19 = 107
This is too high.
Now let's try 88 - 19 = 69.
Then we combine 69 with 28:
69 + 28 = 97
This is also too high.
Let's try another combination: 88 - 28 = 60.
Now we need 19 to reach 79:
60 + 19 = 79
This combination works.
So, the equation is 88 - 28 + 19 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 28) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 19, and 28. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations to get the result of 79.
- If we add 88 and 19, we get 107, which is close but too high.
- If we subtract 28 from 88, we get 60. Now, if we add 19 to 60, we get 79.
So, the equation would be: 88 - 28 + 19 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 28 + 19 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 81, 27, 22, and 6. We need to create an equation that equals 70 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
If we look at the numbers, we can notice that 81 - 27 = 54. This is a significant step but not quite 70. Then if we add 22 to 54, we get 76, which is close but still too high. If we add 6 to 54, we get 60, which is closer but negative 10 is too low. What if we do the reverse? If we subtract 6 from the initial result of 54, we get 48. Then adding 22 to 48 gives us 70, which is what we want.
So, the equation would be: (81 - 27 - 6) + 22 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 27 - 6) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 58, 6, and 27. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once with the operations +, -, *, and / to get 37.
We can start by checking if there's a simple operation that might work with these numbers. Let's try subtracting 27 from 58:
58 - 27 = 31
This is close to 37, so we can try to adjust it by adding 6:
31 + 6 = 37
This gives us the desired result of 37, using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 27 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 74, 25, 74, and 87. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once with the operators +, -, *, and /. We should check different combinations to see if we can reach 36.
Let's try:
(87 - 74) + 25 = 13 + 25 = 38, not 36
Next, let's try:
74 + (87 - 74) = 74 + 13 = 87, not 36
Then:
74 + 25 - 87 = 99 - 87 = 12, not 36
Now, let's try:
74 + 87 - 25 = 161 - 25 = 136, not 36
Another possibility:
74 + 25 + 87 - 169 = 36, not correct because we only have one 169.
Finally, let's try:
74 + 25 + 87 = 186, which is not 36.
Hmm... none of these seem to work. Let's try another approach:
87 - (74 - 25) = 87 - 49 = 38, not 36.
There seems to be a mistake in previous steps. Let's try:
(74 + 74) - 87 - 25 = 148 - 87 - 25 = 36
This works. So the correct equation is:
(74 + 74) - 87 - 25 = 36
</think>
<answer> (74 + 74) - 87 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 79, 37, and 51. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and with basic arithmetic operations to get 93.
One way to approach this is to look for combinations of these numbers that could add up to 93 or use their differences or products to reach 93.
We can try:
(79 - 37) + 51
79 - 37 = 42
42 + 51 = 93
This gives us the equation: (79 - 37) + 51 = 93
</think>
<answer> (79 - 37) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 69, 48, and 64. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each of these numbers exactly once with the allowed operations.
One way to approach this is to look for combinations where we can add or subtract to get close to 85.
If we consider 69 - 48 = 21, we can then see that adding 64 would get us close to 85: 21 + 64 = 85.
This way we don't need to use division or multiplication and we use each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 48 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 48, 27, and 54. We need to create an equation that equals 75 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the operations we can use: +, -, *, /.
If we subtract 27 from 54, we get 27. Now we have 48 and 27. Adding these gives 75. So the equation would be:
54 - 27 + 48 = 75
</think>
<answer> 54 - 27 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 48, 27, and 54 that equals 75. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 48 and 27, we get 75, but we can't use 54 in this case as it would not make the equation true.
- If we subtract 27 from 48, we get 21, and adding 54 would exceed 75, and subtracting 54 from 48 would be less than 75.
- If we subtract 54 from 48, we get -8, and adding 27 would be less than 75.
- If we multiply 48 and 27, we get 1332, which is far from 75.
- If we divide 48 by 27, we get approximately 1.78, which again doesn't help us reach 75.
- If we consider different combinations of addition and subtraction, we can see that 54 - 27 + 48 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 54 - 27 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 39, 85, 24, and 43 exactly once to get 21. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One possible combination is: (85 - 43) + (39 - 24)
(85 - 43) = 42
(39 - 24) = 15
Now, add these results: 42 + 15 = 57
This doesn't give us 21, so this combination isn't correct.
Another combination: (85 - 39) + (43 - 24)
(85 - 39) = 46
(43 - 24) = 19
Now, add these results: 46 + 19 = 65
This also doesn't give us 21, so this combination isn't correct either.
Let's try: (39 + 24) - (85 - 43)
(39 + 24) = 63
(85 - 43) = 42
Now, subtract these results: 63 - 42 = 21
This gives us the desired result.
</think>
<answer> (39 + 24) - (85 - 43) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 80, 59, and 48 that results in 27. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 80 - 59 - 48 = -27 (This is not 27)
- 80 - 59 + 48 = 69 (This is not 27)
- 80 + 59 - 48 = 91 (This is not 27)
- 80 + 59 + 48 = 187 (This is not 27)
- 59 - 80 + 48 = 27 (This equals 27)
So, the equation using the numbers 80, 59, and 48 that equals 27 is 59 - 80 + 48.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 80 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 12, 41, and 21. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each that equals 50.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
12 + 41 = 53 (too high)
41 + 21 = 62 (too high)
12 + 41 - 21 = 32 (too low)
We need to check other possibilities:
41 + 12 - 21 = 32 (too low)
Let's try 41 - (12 - 21):
41 - (12 - 21) = 41 - (-9) = 41 + 9 = 50
This works!
</think>
<answer> 41 + (21 - 12) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 12, 41, and 21 exactly once to make 50. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trying 41 + 21 + 12: 41 + 21 + 12 = 74 (too high)
- Trying 41 + 21 - 12: 41 + 21 - 12 = 50 (this could work)
- Trying 41 + 21 * 12: 41 + 21 * 12 = 41 + 252 = 293 (too high)
- Trying 41 * 21 + 12: 41 * 21 + 12 = 861 + 12 = 873 (too high)
So the equation 41 + 21 - 12 correctly equals 50.
</think>
<answer> 41 + 21 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 1, 39, 35, and 74. We need to use each number exactly once to create an equation that equals 77.
If we look at the numbers, 74 - 35 = 39, which is one of our numbers. This gives us a potential part of our equation. Now we need to use 1 to reach 77.
So, if we take 39 + 1 = 40, we are not there yet. But if we consider 39 + 35 - 1 = 73, which is close to 77, we can adjust it by adding 4 more. Notice that 74 - 39 = 35, and with 35 + 1 = 36, we are still close.
Putting it all together, we have:
39 + (74 - 35 - 1) = 77
Let's break this apart:
74 - 35 = 39
39 - 1 = 38
39 + 38 = 77
So, the equation is 39 + (74 - 35 - 1) which simplifies to 77.
</think>
<answer> 39 + (74 - 35 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 65, 5, 20, and 26. We need to create an equation that results in 76 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 65 + 5 + 20 + 26 = 96 (too high)
- 65 + 5 + 26 - 20 = 71 (too low)
- 65 + 20 - 5 + 26 = 106 (too high)
- 65 - 5 + 20 + 26 = 96 (too high)
- 65 + 20 + 26 - 5 = 111 (too high)
- 65 - 20 + 5 + 26 = 71 (too low)
It seems like a combination including subtraction is needed.
- 65 + 20 + 26 - 5 = 111 - 35 = 76
- But we need to test simpler combinations.
Let's try another step:
- 65 - 20 + 26 + 5 = 26 + 26 + 5 = 71 (too low)
- So, let's try this:
5 + 20 + 65 - 26 = 25 + 65 - 26 = 90 - 26 = 64 (still too low)
Then let's try this one:
Let's try: 65 + 20 + 5 - 26 = 85 - 26 = 59 (too low)
Now let's try:
(65 - 20) + 26 + 5 = 45 + 26 + 5 = 76
So, the equation that equals to 76 with the numbers 65, 5, 20, and 26 is (65 - 20) + 26 + 5.
</think>
<answer>(65 - 20) + 26 + 5</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 18, 7, and 64 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 62. Let's try different combinations:
First, consider adding and subtracting: 
18 + 7 + 64 = 89 (not 62)
Next, let's try 64 - 18 - 7 = 39 (not 62)
What about 64 + 18 - 7 = 75 (not 62)
Now let's try a different combination:
64 - (18 + 7) = 64 - 25 = 39 (not 62)
Let's try rearranging and adding 7 and 18:
(64 - 18) - 7 = 46 - 7 = 39 (not 62)
Perhaps we can use multiplication and subtraction:
(64 - 18) * 7 = 46 * 7 = 322 (not 62)
That didn't work. Now, let's try 18 * 7 - 64:
18 * 7 = 126 - 64 = 62
This works! So the equation is 18 * 7 - 64 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 18 * 7 - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 57, 76, and 45. We need to use all these numbers exactly once and perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 88.
We can try different combinations:
- If we add 57 and 76, we get 133. Then 133 + 45 = 178, which is too large.
- If we subtract 45 from 76, we get 31. Then 57 + 31 = 88, which is correct.
So the correct combination is 76 - 45 + 57 = 88.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 45 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 76, and 45 that equals 88. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
Let's start with addition and subtraction:
57 + 76 = 133
133 - 45 = 88
This works! 57 + 76 - 45 equals 88.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 76 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 80, 52, and 67 that equals 95. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we take 80 - 52 = 28, then we need an operation that, when combined with 67, equals 95.
28 + 67 = 95, which equals our target number.
So, the equation using the numbers in the order they appear as per my calculation is 80 - 52 + 67 = 95.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 52 + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 30, 71, and 61 that equals 40. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One way to approach this is to consider whether combining the numbers directly might work or if I need to rearrange them.
Let's try different operations:
(71 - 30) + 61 = 41
(71 + 30) - 61 = 39
71 - 61 + 30 = 40
This last combination gives us the desired result of 40.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 61 + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 55, and 40. We need to use each exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 16.
- One approach could be to try subtracting one number from another and then adding or multiplying the result with the third number.
- Let's try 55 - 40 = 15, and then 15 - 1 = 14, which is not 16.
- Another approach is to try 55 - 40 = 15, and then 15 / 1 = 15, which is not 16 either.
- Now, let's try a different combination: 55 - 1 = 54, and 54 / 40 isn't meaningful.
- Let's try a sequence: 55 - 40 = 15, and then use multiplication or division with 1. But these don't yield 16.
- Let's try: (55 - 40) + 1 = 6, but this isn't 16.
- Another sequence: 55 / 40 = 1.375, which isn't an integer possibility.
- Finally, let's try 55 - 40 + 1: This simplifies to 1 + 55 = 56, which is also invalid.
- Now, I see a combination that seems promising 55 - 40 + 1 = 6, and 6 * 1 = 6 isn't 16.
- Another missed opportunity was: (55 + 40) / 1 = 95, and again, this isn't 16.
- Now, let's try 55 - (40/1) = 55 - 40 = 15 is continued, and then 15 + 1 = 16.
Based on abovementioned reasoning, the correct equation is: 55 - 40 + 1 = 16.
</think>
<answer> 55 - 40 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 16, 3, and 27 that equals 75. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). One approach is to start with multiplication or addition since these can quickly increase the value.
- Adding the three numbers: 16 + 3 + 27 = 46, which is too low.
- Subtracting the numbers: 27 - 16 - 3 = 8, which is also too low.
- Multiplying and then adding: 16 * 3 + 27 = 48 + 27 = 75, which is what we want.
So, we have used 16, 3, and 27 to get 75 with multiplication and addition.
</think>
<answer> 16 * 3 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 70, 89, and 87 that equals 72. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I notice that 89 - 87 = 2. Now I need something that, when combined with 70 and 2, gives 72.
If I take 70 + 2, I get 72. So the equation seems to be 70 + (89 - 87).
</think>
<answer> 70 + (89 - 87) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 24, 23, and 70 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that results in 23.
I see that 70 - 24 = 46, which is not 23.
If I use 70 - 23, I get 47, which isn't 23 either.
Subtracting 24 from 70 will get me closer to 23, so let's try 70 - 24 - 23.
70 - 24 equals 46, and 46 - 23 equals 23.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 24 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 24, 23, and 70. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to make the result 23.
- One way to approach this is to try to use subtraction to decrease the larger numbers.
- If we subtract 23 from 70, we get 47.
- But we still need to use 24, and 47 + 24 = 71, which is too large.
- Let's try another approach: 70 - 24 - 23
- 70 - 24 equals 46.
- Now, if we subtract 23 from 46, we get 23.
So, the equation is 70 - 24 - 23 = 23.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 24 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 86, 20, 55, and 68 that equals 93. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One way to approach this is to check if the numbers can be manipulated to reach 93 directly or indirectly.
If we look closely, 86 - 55 = 31, and then we would need 62 more to reach 93. However, 62 is not directly possible with the remaining numbers 20 and 68 using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Instead, let's try another approach: 86 + 55 = 141, and then we would need to subtract 48 to reach 93. We can form 48 from 68 - 20.
So, the equation is: 86 + 55 - (68 - 20).
</think>
<answer> 86 + 55 - (68 - 20) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 32, 53, and 24 exactly once to get the result of 61.
Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
32 + 53 + 24 = 109 (not 61)
32 + 53 - 24 = 61 (this could be the answer, let's verify the other numbers used)
32 * 53 / 24 = 73. 33 (not 61)
53 * 24 / 32 = 39. 375 (not 61)
None of the other mixes worked, so the only mix working is 32 + 53 - 24.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 53 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 49, 86, and 8 that equals 45. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with these numbers.
If we start with 86 - 49, we get 37, which isn't 45.
If we use 86 - 8, we get 78, which is too high.
Let's try 86 - 49 + 8. This gives us 45.
So the equation is 86 - 49 + 8 = 45.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 49 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 23, 67, 16, and 31 that equals 75. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One combination that works is: 67 - 23 + 16 + 31
Let's check if this works:
67 - 23 = 44
44 + 16 = 60
60 + 31 = 91
This is not 75, so this combination doesn't work.
Let's try another one: 67 - 16 + 23 + 31
67 - 16 = 51
51 + 23 = 74
74 + 31 = 105
This is also incorrect.
Now, let's try: 67 + 16 - 23 + 31
67 + 16 = 83
83 - 23 = 60
60 + 31 = 91
This is not 75 either.
Let's try: 67 + 31 - 23 + 16
67 + 31 = 98
98 - 23 = 75
75 + 16 = 91
This is not 75 either.
Finally, let's try: 67 - 31 + 23 + 16
67 - 31 = 36
36 + 23 = 59
59 + 16 = 75
This works! Therefore, the equation is: 67 - 31 + 23 + 16 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 31 + 23 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 77, 41, and 6 that equals 42. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
77 + 41 + 6 = 124 (This is too high)
77 + 41 - 6 = 112 (This is also too high)
77 + 6 - 41 = 42 (This is correct)
41 + 6 - 77 = -29 (This is too low)
The correct equation that equals 42 is 77 + 6 - 41.
</think>
<answer> 77 + 6 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 77, 41, and 6. We need to create an equation that equals 42 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combining these numbers in different ways:
- 77 - 41 = 36 (This is not 42)
- 77 - 6 = 71 (This is not 42)
- 77 + 41 = 118 (This is not 42)
- 41 + 6 = 47 (This is not 42)
It seems like simple addition or subtraction doesn't work. Let's try multiplication and division:
- 77 * 41 / 6 = 556.1666... (This is not an integer and not 42)
- 77 * 6 / 41 = 11.1863... (This is not 42)
- 41 * 6 / 77 = 0.3580... (This is not 42)
Finally, let's try:
- 77 - 41 + 6 = 42
This gives us the result 42, using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 41 + 6 </answer>

<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 31, 21, and 65 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations that equals 55.
Let's try different combinations:
31 + 21 + 65 = 117 (too high)
31 + 65 - 21 = 75 (too high)
65 + 21 - 31 = 55 (this seems to work)
So the equation is 65 + 21 - 31 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 21 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 89, 35, 61, and 93 exactly once to get 86. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One possible way could be: 93 - 35 + 61 - 89
Now, let's calculate this:
93 - 35 = 58
58 + 61 = 119
119 - 89 = 30
This is not 86. Let's try another combination.
Another possible way could be: 93 - 89 + 35 + 61
Now, let's calculate this:
93 - 89 = 4
4 + 35 = 39
39 + 61 = 100
This is not 86 either. 
Another possibility could be: 93 - 89 + 61 - 35
Now, let's calculate this:
93 - 89 = 4
4 + 61 = 65
65 - 35 = 30
This is still not 86.
Finally, let's try this: 61 + 35 - 93 + 89
Now, let's calculate this:
61 + 35 = 96
96 - 93 = 3
3 + 89 = 92
This is still not 86.
After trying different combinations, it appears I need to rethink the operations. Let's try: (93 - 89) + 61 - 35
Now, let's calculate this step by step:
93 - 89 = 4
4 + 61 = 65
65 - 35 = 30
This still doesn't match 86. Rechecking properly, let's try this combination: (93 - 89) + (61 - 35)
Now, let's calculate:
93 - 89 = 4
61 - 35 = 26
4 + 26 = 30
Still don't match 86.
Rechecking combinations, let’s then try this: 93 - (89 - 35) + 61
Now, let's calculate:
93 - (89 - 35) = 93 - 54 = 39
39 + 61 = 100
This is still not correct.
I then checked: 93 - 61 - 35 + 89
Now, let's calculate:
93 - 61 = 32
32 - 35 = -3
-3 + 89 = 86
This matches 86!
So the equation is: 93 - 61 - 35 + 89
</think>
<answer> 93 - 61 - 35 + 89 </answer>

<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 44, 9, and 24 that equals 29. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
1. 44 - 9 - 24: This equals 11, not 29.
2. 44 - 9 + 24: This equals 61, not 29.
3. 44 + 9 - 24: This equals 29.
4. 44 + 9 / 24: This involves a fractional result, not 29.
5. 44 * 9 - 24: This is 396 - 24 = 372, not 29.
The only combination that works is 44 + 9 - 24.
</think>
<answer> 44 + 9 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 44, 9, and 24 that equals 29, with each number used only once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Trying multiplication and addition/subtraction: (44 + 9) - 24 = 49 - 24 = 25
- Trying another combination: 44 - (24 + 9) = 44 - 33 = 11
- Now let's try: 44 - 24 + 9
If we calculate 44 - 24 + 9, we get 20 + 9 = 29.
This works! So the equation is 44 - 24 + 9.
</think>
<answer> 44 - 24 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 44, 9, and 24 exactly once to get 29. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possibility could be 44 - 24 + 9.
44 - 24 = 20
20 + 9 = 29
So the equation is 44 - 24 + 9.
</think>
<answer> 44 - 24 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 3, 48, and 11. We need to form an equation that uses these numbers exactly once to get the result 81.
We can start by checking if any combination of basic arithmetic operations can produce 81:
- Adding the numbers: 3 + 48 + 11 = 62
- Subtracting numbers: 48 - 3 - 11 = 34
- Multiplying numbers: There's no straightforward combination that gives 81.
We don't need to consider division as we can't get a whole number result from dividing 48, 3, or 11.
So, it appears we need to use operations on pairs or all three numbers. Let's try multiplication:
3 * 48 = 144
Now, let's subtract 11: 144 - 11 = 133
This isn't 81 either, but what if we re-adjust? Let's try another approach:
(48 - 3) * 11 = 45 * 11 = 495
This is still not 81. It looks like we need a different arrangement or operation. Let's try another multiplication followed by addition:
(11 * 3) + 48 = 33 + 48 = 81
Now we get the desired result 81. So the equation is (11 * 3) + 48 = 81.
</think>
<answer> (11 * 3) + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 8, and 12. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and the arithmetic operations to result in 80.
We can start by trying different combinations:
- Adding 76 and 12 gives us 88, which is close but too high.
- Subtracting 12 from 76 gives us 64, which is still not 80.
- Multiplying 8 and 12 gives us 96, which is too high.
- Subtracting the product of 8 and 12 (which is 96) from 76 gives us -26, so this doesn't work.
We need to try other combinations:
- Let's try 76 - 8 - 12. This gives us 76 - 8 - 12 = 56, which is still not 80.
- Now let's see what happens if we try 76 - (8 + 12). This is 76 - 20 = 56, still not 80.
We seem to have exhausted simple arithmetic operations, so let's re-evaluate:
- Let's check if there's any other order of operations that produces 80.
- 76 + 12 - 8 would give us 76 + 12 - 8 = 80, which is exactly what we need.
So the equation is 76 + 12 - 8 = 80.
</think>
<answer> 76 + 12 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 76, 8, and 12 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations that results in 80.
I notice that 76 + 12 = 88, which is close to 80 but a bit too high.
If I subtract 8 from 88, I get 80.
So the equation would be: 76 + 12 - 8 = 80.
</think>
<answer> 76 + 12 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 43, 55, and 37 that equals 61. Let's try combining them in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
- If I add 43 and 55, I get 98. Then, subtracting 37 from 98 gives me 61 (98 - 37 = 61).
- This satisfies the requirement of using each number only once.
- So the equation is 43 + 55 - 37 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 55 - 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 87, 65, and 41 exactly once that equals 36. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possibility could be: (87 - 75) - (65 - 41)
Now let's calculate this:
87 - 75 = 12
65 - 41 = 24
12 - 24 = -12
This does not give us 36. Let's try another combination:
(87 - 65) + 41 - 75
Calculating this:
87 - 65 = 22
22 + 41 = 63
63 - 75 = -12
This also doesn't work. Let's try:
(75 + 41) - (87 - 65)
Calculating this:
75 + 41 = 116
87 - 65 = 22
116 - 22 = 94
Still not 36. Let's simplify to just checking if any single operation satisfies:
Checking (87 - 75) + 41 - 65:
87 - 75 = 12
12 + 41 = 53
53 - 65 = -12
Now trying a different pair:
(87 - 65) + (75 - 41):
87 - 65 = 22
75 - 41 = 34
22 + 34 = 56
Trying 34 + (87 - 75) seems simpler:
75 - 87 = -12
34 - 12 = 22
Then another:
87 + 41 - 75 - 65:
87 + 41 = 128
128 - 75 = 53
53 - 65 = -12
Finally, trying:
87 - (75 - 41) + 65:
75 - 41 = 34
87 - 34 = 53
53 + 65 = 118
Let's try differently and in a simpler way:
(75 - 65) + (87 - 41):
75 - 65 = 10
87 - 41 = 46
10 + 46 = 56
Trying this systematically:
(87-41) + (75 -65) = 46 + 10 = 56
Next simpler attempt:
75 - 41 + 87 - 65 = 36
Checking:
34 + 22 = 56
After rechecking, we get:
41 + 87 - 75 - 65:
 41 + 87 = 128
 128 - 75 = 53
 53 - 65 = -12
Finally, back to simpler:
75 - (87-65 + 41) = 75 - 41 = 34
87 - (75 -41 + 65) = 36
Try 87 - (75 - 41 + 65) :
87 - 19 = 68 
Re-checking:
87 - (65 - 41 + 75)
87 -  3 = 84
(87 - 65) + 41 - 75:
22 + 41 - 75:
12 - 75 = -63
(87 - 75) + 65 - 41
10 + 65 - 41 = 34
Finally:
87 - (75 + 65 - 41):
87 -  99 = -12
Try:
87 - (75 + 41 - 65) = 87 - 51 = 36
</think>
<answer> 87 - (75 + 41 - 65) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 10, 38, and 99. We need to create an equation that equals 71 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combining 10 and 38 first: 
10 + 38 = 48
Now we need 23 more to reach 71 (since 71 - 48 = 23).
We're left with the number 99, and 99 - 76 = 23 (since 99 - 76 = 23).
So the equation can be (99 - 38) + 10 = 71.
</think>
<answer>(99 - 38) + 10</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 9, and 66 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If I divide 66 by 9, I get 7.22 (not close to 55).
- If I divide 66 by 20, I get 3.3 (again, not close to 55).
- If I add 20 and 9, I get 29. Now, if I divide 66 by 29, I get 2.275 (still not 55).
- If I try another combination: 66 - 20 = 46, then 46 - 9 = 37 (still not 55).
- Another try: 66 - 20 = 46, and then 46 + 9 = 55, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is 66 - 20 + 9 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 20 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 72, and 16 that equals 44. Let's try different combinations:
- 72 - 12 - 16 = 44 (72 - 12 = 60, then 60 - 16 = 44)
- 72 - 12 + 16 = 76 (Let's skip this because we need 44)
- 72 + 12 - 16 = 68 (Let's skip this because we need 44)
- 72 + 12 + 16 = 100 (Let's skip this because we need 44)
From the above combinations, the equation 72 - 12 - 16 = 44 works and uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 12 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 72, and 16 that equals 44. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- 72 - 12 - 16 = 44 (This works as it uses all numbers exactly once and applies subtraction)
This combination satisfies the conditions of the problem. Now, I'll express this in the required format.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 12 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 55, and 29. We need to arrange these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 66.
Let's try different combinations:
- 55 + 29 = 84 (which is not 66)
- 55 - 29 = 26 (which is not 66)
- 40 + 55 = 95 (which is not 66)
- 40 + 29 = 69 (which is not 66)
- 55 - 40 = 15 (which is not 66)
Now, let's consider using multiplication or division:
- 55 * 29 / 40 = 4045 / 40 = 100. 125 (which is not 66)
- 55 * 40 / 29 = 2200 / 29 = 75. 862 (which is not 66)
- 29 * 40 / 55 = 1160 / 55 = 21. 454 (which is not 66)
Finally, let's try a different combination:
40 + (55 - 29) = 40 + 26 = 66
This gives us the result we need.
</think>
<answer> 40 + (55 - 29) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 83, 72, and 72. We need to create an equation using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations that equals 83.
We can start by looking at the difference between 83 and 72:
83 - 72 = 11
However, this does not use the third 72. We should try another combination. Let's consider adding and dividing:
(83 + 72) / 72 = 155 / 72, which is not 83.
Now, let's try another approach:
72 - (83 / 72) might not work since we need integer operations.
Another trial would be:
72 + (83 / 72), but this also doesn't give us an integer result.
Finally, let's use:
72 + (83 - 72) = 72 + 11 = 83.
This gives us the correct result of 83.
</think>
<answer> 72 + (83 - 72) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 83, 72, and 72 that results in 83. I can start by considering if any combination of these numbers using basic arithmetic can achieve this.
One way to approach this is to try various combinations:
1. 83 - 72 - 72 (This would give a negative number, so that won't work)
2. 83 - 72 + 72 (This isn't correct either)
3. 83 + 72 - 72 (This just reduces to 83, which is the number we want)
So, 83 + 72 - 72 = 83
This seems correct. Let's verify by calculating it:
83 + 72 = 155
155 - 72 = 83
Therefore the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 83 + 72 - 72 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 60, 24, and 46 that results in 38, I need to consider all possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One way to approach this is to look for operations that might reduce the value of the larger numbers effectively.
If I subtract 60 and 24 from 46, I get:
46 - 60 - 24 = -38
This gives me the negative value of 38, so to get the positive 38, I need to consider if there's a different combination or if I've made a valid equation by mistake.
Now, let's try another combination: 
46 - (60 / 24) = 46 - 2.5 = 43.5
This doesn't give us the value 38 either.
Finally, let's try:
(46 - 60) + 24 = -14 + 24 = 10
This doesn't work either.
Next, let's try:
(60 - 46) + 24 = 14 + 24 = 38
This gives us the value 38, so the equation that works is:
(60 - 46) + 24 = 38
</think>
<answer> (60 - 46) + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 60, 24, and 46. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once, with the operations +, -, *, and / to get the result of 38.
Let's try different combinations:
- 60 - 24 - 46 = -50 (not 38)
- 60 - 24 + 46 = 78 (not 38)
- 60 + 24 + 46 = 130 (not 38)
- 60 + 24 - 46 = 38 (this is 38)
So, we have found that 60 + 24 - 46 equals 38.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 24 - 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 97, 42, and 8. We need to make an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combining the numbers and operations:
97 - 42 + 8 = 55
This is close but not our target. Let's try another combination:
97 - 42 - 8 = 47
This directly equals 47.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 42 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 97, 42, and 8. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combinations:
- 97 - 42 - 8 = 47 (This works! All numbers are used and the equation is valid. )
- 97 - 42 + 8 = 53
- 97 + 42 - 8 = 131
- 97 + 42 + 8 = 147
Among these, 97 - 42 - 8 = 47 is the correct equation.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 42 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers and basic operations we can use: 58, 2, 49, and the operations +, -, *, /. We need to create an equation that equals 78 using each number only once.
We can start by looking at the numbers and considering their relationships:
- 58 + 20 = 78, but 20 is not in the set.
- 58 - 40 = 8 not 78.
- 58 * 0. 4 = 26. 5 which is not 78.
- 49 + 29 = 78, but 29 is not in the set.
- We notice that 58 - 49 = 9. Adding 2 more won't get us exactly 78 thus we cannot form 78 using only these numbers and operations.
Now let's try 49 + (58 / 2):
- 58 / 2 = 29
- Then 49 + 29 = 78
Thus, the equation is 49 + (58 / 2) = 78.
</think>
<answer> 49 + (58 / 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 66, 27, and 47 exactly once to get a result of 46. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 66 + 27 + 47 = 139 (This is too high)
- 66 + 27 - 47 = 46 (This is a good candidate as it equals 46)
- 66 + 47 - 27 = 86 (This is too high)
- 27 + 47 - 66 = 7 (This is too low)
- 66 * 27 / 47 (This won't work as it involves multiplication and division which would need parentheses to ensure the order is right and this doesn't give 46)
- 27 * 47 / 66 (This is also invalid for the same reason)
Thus, the correct combination is 66 + 27 - 47 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 27 - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 66, 27, and 47. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to get the result of 46.
66 + 27 - 47 = 46
We can break it down:
66 + 27 = 93
Then, 93 - 47 = 46
This meets our requirement as we used all the numbers exactly once and got the desired result.
</think>
<answer> (66 + 27) - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 93, 14, and 7 that equals 100, with each number used only once.
Let's try combining them in different ways with arithmetic operations:
93 - 14 = 79
Now, we need 21 more to reach 100:
79 + 21 = 100
And 21 can be created as 7 * 3. Since 3 is not in the list, this combination doesn't work.
Let's try another approach:
93 - 7 = 86
Then we need 14 more to reach 100:
86 + 14 = 100
This works and all numbers are used exactly once.
So the equation is 93 - 7 + 14 = 100.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 7 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 18, 69, and 8 that equals 79. Let's try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
One possible combination could be: 69 - 18 + 8
If we start with 69, subtract 18, and then add 8:
69 - 18 = 51
51 + 8 = 59
But this doesn't give us 79.
Another combination could be: 69 + 18 - 8
If we start with 69, add 18, and then subtract 8:
69 + 18 = 87
87 - 8 = 79
This gives us the required result of 79.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 18 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 18, 69, and 8 that equals 79. Let's try to use addition and subtraction to get close to 79.
If I add 18 and 69, I get 87. To get to 79 from 87, I should subtract 8.
So the equation would be: 18 + 69 - 8 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 18 + 69 - 8 </answer>
