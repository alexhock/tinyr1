Using the numbers [44, 19, 35], create an equation that equals 98. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once.

Let me solve this step by step.

First, I'll consider the possible operations and how they could combine these numbers to reach 98. The goal is to make use of all three numbers: 44, 19, and 35. 

Considering multiplication as it could potentially lead us closer to our target, let's try multiplying 44 by either 19 or 35. 

If we multiply 44 by 35, we get:
44 * 35 = 1540

This is too high, so we should try other combinations. Let's look at dividing 44 by 19:
44 / 19 â‰ˆ 2.31578947368

This result seems too small to help directly, so let's think about combining the division and multiplication in a way to get closer to 98.

Now, let's see if we can achieve 98 using a combination of addition and subtraction with these numbers.
</think>

After trying different combinations, let's see if we can find a solution.
<think>
I'll now consider another approach where we use subtraction and addition. 
44 - 19 = 25
Then we need 73 more to reach 98. We have 35 left, which could help.
25 + 35 = 60
So far, we have 33 more needed to reach 98. This is close to 35 - 2 = 33. 
Hence, 60 + (35 - 2) = 98.
</think>

Thus, the final equation is:
<answer> (44 - 19) + (35 - 2) </answer>
